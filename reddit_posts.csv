Rumble: Huge Asymmetric Opportunity to the Upside? Multiple Catalysts ,"Here is my second attempt at posting. Rumble stock ownership breakdown: (1) Insiders 62% (2) Dan Bongino 10% (3) Institutions 23%. That comes out to 95% ownership 1,2 and 3. How is it possible that 14 million shares are currently held short and listed as 16% of the float? The math here isn't adding up. Until I realized that the outstanding shares used to calculate float also includes warrants (i.e. call options) that were issued when Rumble went SPAC/IPO that have strike prices of $10 and $17. Given that the stock is currently trading at $5.27, it makes no sense that the warrants should also be calculated in the float size. Anyways, it is clear that there is some funny business (naked shorting a definite) going on here.

As for the business, Rumble web traffic is up nearly 40% year over year and the share price hasn't reflected this bump at all. Also, this is only year 1 that Rumble started monetizing its platform with ads (started in 2024) and also launched a cloud service (started in April). In year 1, they are already on pace to have $100 million in revenue. That's pretty insane for any business.¬†

For comparison, Redditt has a market cap of $10 billion with a similar small (compared to other platforms like Meta, etc) but very devoted user base like Rumble. I don't see why Rumble couldn't 2-3x its market cap with such a high growth rate and monetization has only just started. For instance, their cloud business has already landed two big names in Hard Rock Hotel and Miami Dolphins only a few months after launching the service.

Thoughts: Given the strange math in the share ownership (likely heavily naked short) and rapidly growing business. I think this is a great risk to reward play. Not to mention that IF Trump were to win, the stock could easily double in a few days. The stock price moves almost in tandem with the election odds for Trump. I'm not going to make a guess at who wins, but it's a 50/50 at this point and the short term upside is huge.¬†",2024-09-19,0.6249,0.9938,0.80935

TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Japan's consumer inflation rate likely picked up for the fourth straight month in August, a Reuters poll of 20 economists showed, tracking comfortably above the central bank's 2% target and keeping alive expectations for more rate hikes ahead.

The core Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which excludes fresh food but includes energy items, likely rose 2.8% year-on-year in August, ticking up from a 2.7% rise in the previous month.

China Equities Could Bottom,"In June of this year, I began building positions in Chinese equities, focusing particularly on undervalued stocks such as Alibaba, AIG, and Geely Auto. I also invested in BYD Auto, primarily driven by thematic considerations.

The recent 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed signals the start of an aggressive easing cycle. This move may help mitigate further depreciation of the RMB and pave the way for stronger monetary and fiscal stimulus in China. The real rates in China have remained particularly high for an economy showing deflationary tendencies. This might be an interesting juncture for Chinese monetary policy to loosen.

I believe the risk-reward profile for Chinese value equities is favorable, especially in the short term, and we could see a strong rally ahead of the US elections. A potential win for Harris could further enhance market sentiment.",2024-09-19,0.0,0.9578,0.4789
Why the market sell off after rate cuts? ,"The market was pricing in a rate cut schedule that was more aggressive than what the fed announced.

1. He was asked if they had known the July jobs data if they would have cut rates and he said ‚Äúprobably.‚Äù

2. He said he was less confident in the jobs numbers as they kept getting revised down.

Neither of these would be a problem on their own but he also said he believed the fed was not behind the curve on addressing labor market (contradicting number 1.) And he said the Fed was purely data driven in their response, which begs the question of whether or not they have accurate and up to date data. Hence the sell off.",2024-09-19,-0.296,-0.6361,-0.46604999999999996
Delta Airlines (DAL) DD: Reaffirmation of long position following 2-week bull run,"Since my last DD on Delta Airlines (DAL) 2 weeks ago, DAL has run up by 12%, trading from 42 to 47. During this time, several readers pointed out valid concerns regarding the investment. I am updating my DD after two weeks to reflect developments regarding DAL as well as to address some of the outstanding concerns. ¬†

In this post, I will touch on the following¬†

* Current news, analyst upgrades, and mid-quarter guidance from Delta¬†
* Address potential concerns about DAL¬†
* Further explore Delta‚Äôs competitive advantage and market position strength¬†
* Re-affirm my original price target of 56, representing another 20% upside by EOY 2024, despite the increasing valuation¬†

¬†

**Current News and Updated Guidance**¬†

* While the Fed rate cuts are at the forefront of investors' minds, fuel and oil prices are on the decline, both trends that benefit DAL¬†
* DAL outlines macro tailwinds in their recent mid-quarter guidance¬†

   * 7/13 BOA assigns BUY on DAL¬†
   * 7/17 TD Cowen maintains buy on DAL¬†
   * 7/17 Evercore gives buy rating on DAL¬†

**Addressing the main concerns outlined by critics of my previous DD:**¬†

Main concerns:¬†

* Airlines industry is too competitive, pressuring margins and limiting return to investors¬†
* Airlines are capital intensive, using high leverage to sustain their expensive aircraft fleets¬†
* There has been no fundamental change to Delta‚Äôs value proposition and market position¬†
* Technical Analysis on the long term is unreliable¬†

Response to concerns:¬†

Airline industry competition and margins ‚Äì while the industry has been historically competitive, several key trends are strengthening the industry as a whole:¬†

* Oil and fuel prices declining, increasing margins¬†
* Rational supply control and elimination of excess routes by airlines inorganically raising demand¬†
* Rate cuts and consumer confidence leading to increasing demand from both corporate and leisure¬†

Capital intensive and high debt ‚Äì while DAL took on high debt, it is actively making debt repayments and becoming investment grade top priorities¬†

* DAL‚Äôs debt is 94% fixed rate, reducing volatility associated with interest rates¬†
* DAL already has lower debt ratios than most of its peers¬†
* Fed rate cut opens the door for potentially favorable interest rate negotiations on debt¬†

No fundamental change in value proposition ‚Äì DAL has consistently been an industry leader in terms of operations and reliability¬†

* Recent surveys and DAL demand demonstrates negligible brand impact from CRWD outage¬†
* Weakness in LUV and AAL (AAL dropping from S&P 500) further strengthens DAL as the major player in the industry¬†
* DAL‚Äôs leading ROE, ROA, and ROIC (13%) in the industry make it the most reliable¬†choice for gaining exposure to air travel demand¬†

Technical analysis in the long term is unreliable ‚Äì while I am not a professional on technical analysis, it certainly helps the thesis¬†

* Long-term positive technical trends help support the argument that DAL and airline industry is trending up¬†
* Short term MA outpacing long term 200MA indicates short-term momentum¬†

¬†

**Why DAL maintains stronger ROIC, ROA, ROE, and operating margins than its peers**¬†

* Main thesis ‚Äì competitive advantage driven by its newer fleet compared to peers¬†
   * Newer fleet drives its strong brand strength, strong operational reliability, strong operating margins¬†
* Why newer fleet is a MOAT and hard to imitate¬†
   * New aircraft supply constraints¬†
   * High switching costs, debt costs for new aircraft¬†
* How new fleet drives brand¬†
   * Brand strength built on operational reliability, experience¬†
   * Newer planes are easier to maintain, less unexpected issues¬†
   * Better customer experience on newer planes compared to peers¬†
* How new fleet drives superior margins¬†
   * Newer planes are more fuel efficient, lower fuel consumption and costs¬†
   * Newer planes are less expensive to maintain¬†
   * Stronger brand, reliability, and experience allows DAL to charge a premium¬†

**Outlook and Current Positions**¬†

* I am maintaining my bullish outlook and my price target of 56 by EOY 2024, though now I am even more confident in my forecast¬†
* My current DAL positions (total market value of 24.8k)¬†

Un-Employment Year End Stays the Same,"The exact same scenario happened in 2007.

We started off with a 50 cut from 5.25% in Sept. '07 and went all the way to 3.50% by January '08. This was due to how fast unemployement was rising. But the FEDs target right now is 3.50% end of 2025.

GDP was the exact same growth rate as today and unemployment was the exact same as well. The only thing we can watch for is if unemployment rises as fast as it did in '07. Mortgage applications are increasing with a ton of people on the sideline ready to purchase homes.

The current layoffs are from companies over-hiring from COVID so they can get back to pre pandemic levels.

Two things to remember as we enter the new era,"1) lower interest rates mean lower discounting of future cash flow -> future growth is worth more in the present 

2) lower interest rates -> more debt available to the rich

Combine these two and you get more money piling into VC, looking for growth. We‚Äôre still a long way away from ZIRP, but every bp down will move money in this direction 

Where does that money go? Take a look at the recent YC batches and you‚Äôll see that the majority of it is going and will be going into AI startups.

Basic DD,"One way of determining the fair value of a company is by projecting its free cash flow. NVIDIAs free cash flow stagnated according to August's report, and so did Morningstar's calculated fair value. The federal reserve rate is also inversely proportional to a company's fair value as follows:

Fair value \~  projected free cash flow/(interest rate - growth rate)

  
Without plugging in values for free cash flow we can leave our answer in terms of free cash flow and its units will be those of a familiar multiplier.



Plugging in 5% for interest rate and subtracting 2% for the growth rate yields 1/(0.05 - 0.02) = 1/0.03 = 33

  
What do you know? Its right around the multiplier for SPY.

  
Let's plug in the new interest rate:

  
1/(0.045 - 0.02) = 44

  
Wow! A fifty basis point cut results in a 30% increase in fair value of the overall market.

  
What if we back calculate using NVDIA's multiplier to estimate a terminal growth rate:

  
1/(0.05 - x) = 50

x = 0.030

  
Use this value to calculate post rate cut fair multiplier:

  
1/(0.045 - 0.030) = 66

  
This is also over a 30% increase for the fair value of NVIDIA giving a fair value for NVDA of **152 right now**.

  
I am reiterating my price target of 160 by the end of October for NVDA.

  
God bless America.

Call me Regarded ,"Powell knows that if the S&P falters, Americans wealth will take a huge hit. Consumer confidence and spending will fall, home prices will collapse, and layoffs will be inevitable when the consumer disappears and GDP craters. 

The US economy is tanking, and no one will come to the rescue. China is and has been in a recession for the better part of a year, the eurozone is teetering back and forth, and the US will drag everyone down lower when the sleeping giant loses steam heading into a dark winter. 

This is only the beginning, and who knows how long it may take to work itself out, when there‚Äôs no limit to what the Fed and Govt stimulus can do in efforts to delay (reduce the effects of) the inevitable. 

And no, simply because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet, doesn‚Äôt mean that the odds of it happening are lower. No one knows what the straw will be that breaks the camels backs, but hindsight will be 20/20. Every recession is different, and this next one will dwarf the last. 

A 30% stock/housing market correction at these levels, when everyone is leveraged to the tits with debt would have parts of America looking like Hooverville again. 

So why is everyone acting like we are out of the woods now, when really we‚Äôre just in clearing.

Why did Bill Ackman buy Nike? Seems like their losing market share to guys like LULU.,"I just caught an analysis on Nike via Daniel Pronk and honestly, I'm just confused. The stock dropped about 53% from its all-time highs, and while its tempting, the underlying issues are a bit concerning. 

key takeaways:

* **Sales Decline**: Nike's revenue is reported to be declining, with a projected drop of around 10% year-over-year for the first quarter. This isn't just a one-time hiccup; their fiscal 2025 is looking rough too, with expected mid-single-digit declines. ([Rev and EPS projections](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/NKE/analyst))
* **Market Position**: It was noted that smaller competitors, like Lululemon, are nibbling at Nike's market share. The fashion industry is unpredictable, and you never know which brands will start gaining traction.
* **Valuation Concerns**: With a price-to-free cash flow at 18.4 Does this imply future growth?

"The hype is fun but in my regarded opinion, 50bps is NOT a good sign, and it‚Äôs not bullish","A 25 bps cut would‚Äôve been bullish as fuck because it would‚Äôve shown that everything in the economy was going to plan. That the FEDs soft landing plan was succeeding.

To me, a 50bps cut, and forecasts of another 50bps cut before the end of the year, and then a total of 100bps cut in 2025, seems more like the FED in total panic mode because they realised they have left it too late and are now attempting to play catch up. The way I look at it, they‚Äôve put all the data together, crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion that the economy is starting to look like it will stagnate and they‚Äôre trying by any means possible to reanimate some life into it. 

But will it be enough? I have no fucking idea. Nobody has any idea. The SPY graph today looks like a heartbeat monitor in a hospital scene of a film, clearly no one knows. I‚Äôm waiting for the next quarters data. 

- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone up, and/or inflation has gone up, without any notable growth in inflation adjusted consumer spending, I‚Äôm selling everything and shorting SPY. Hard landing incoming. 

- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone down, without inflation going up a load, and there hasn‚Äôt been any noticeable hit to consumer spending, then it‚Äôs soft landing confirmed. All aboard the bull train.

But seriously, until we get a good amount of data indicating how the cut impacts the economy, no one will have an actually accurate idea whether this marks the start of the greatest bull run ever or the mouth of the cave of stagflation. 
 
That being said, I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm doing and when I was 18 I lost big time on the fucking towel stock so probably inverse what I say idk

Thank You for your market orders,"  
Little bit of patting myself on the back today, and consolation for past losses.  Thank you for whoever bought VRT 1/17 @ 77.5 and LUNR 11/2 @ 11 calls today with market orders and not limit orders, my limit sells appreciate you very much.  
  
This morning on the bump I sold several contracts of VRT at $19.90, and around the same time I sold a single covered call for VRT at $1.25, and then about 30 minutes ago I sold a bunch of ASTS contracts that were going to expire next week for $4.70 (yes I know I held too long and missed out on a lot of gains in days prior).  
  
As of posting this, all three transactions are still the high price for the day.  


TLDR, I sold some contracts today at the high for the day (so far, still 1.5 hours to go) and I'm in a great mood, feeling very not regarded for once.

They will never let the US stock market fail. The only asset that has outperformed inflation time after time has always been the stock market. 

We're already creepin towards stagflation and the only people that gets f*ked are the ones who don't invest. The future of wealth preservation is not savings or CDs or treasuries, get f*ked, it's the stock market. 

We are entering a new phase of the grand US economy and it is the phase of grand dellusion and mass hysteria of inflated wealth.

Why cut 50? What is JPOW hiding?,"One argument for cutting rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, instead of 50 basis points goes like this: The Federal Reserve only makes larger cuts when something is going wrong in the economy or financial system.

And that‚Äôs partly true, but it also misses an important point.

Since the Fed began to publicize interest-rate changes in 1994, the central bank has moved from a neutral stance to a cutting stance six times.

The Fed initiated shallow cutting cycles in 1995, 1998, and 2019, each time leading off with a cut of 25 basis points.

The Fed began what would be deeper cutting cycles three times, in early 2001, 2007, and when the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread in March 2020, each time leading with a cut of 50 basis points.

This has led many analysts to conclude that larger cuts of 50 basis points are ‚Äúreserved‚Äù for more severe situations, and there is some truth to this pattern.

Stock markets were sliding as the tech bubble began to deflate with the Fed cut rates in January 2001 by 50 basis points. The bursting of a subprime mortgage-credit bubble in August 2007 preceded the Fed‚Äôs cut of the same magnitude in September 2007.

At the same time, Fed officials at both of those meetings still thought their more aggressive action might preempt a downturn, according to the transcripts of those meetings. In other words, just because 50-basis-point cuts look, in retrospect, like actions reserved for the start of a recession, officials didn‚Äôt think that way in real time.

Why I am long $PACS,"$PACS

I‚Äôm long PACS. 

What is it? Senior Care Living Facilities.

Why am I long? 

Industry trends:
The senior care Industry is growing at a compound anual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6%. The industry size is currently $958B but projected to be $1.22T by 2030. 
PACS is aggressively growing
Adding 32 new facilities and 12 real estate acquisitions, bringing the total operating facilities to 248 in only 13 states. They‚Äôre opening up to high demand regions like the south east and south west US. Focusing on quality. 165 of its facilities have 4-5 star ratings. 
Diversifying revenue streams:
Health and wellness programs going beyond basic healthcare. Focusing on lifestyle improvements and preventative care, catering to the demand for holistic wellness among seniors. Specialized services such as memory care. (YoY growth rate of Alzheimer‚Äôs is 2.47%)
Real Estate:
PACS owns its facilities and is ever expanding. They‚Äôre capturing operational income and property value appreciation. Their facilities have a 91% occupancy rate which is considered high for this industry. 
Value Based Care Models:
This focus‚Äô on achieving better health outcomes while managing costs. They benefit from performance-based incentives, allowing the company to generate revenue based on the quality and efficiency of care provided rather than the volume of services.

Some numbers:
In Q2 they reported $0.54 EPS, beating the analyst predictions of $0.35. Reported revenue of $982.85 million, beating the predictions by 7.13% ($916.50 million)
Currently trading at 16.5x ebitda. High! But not unheard of, especially for a high growth company like PACS.

For how many goddamn months have we been hearing the goddamn rumors about will they or won't they....get us off this plateau and lower interest rates. The rumor has been ""they will lower interest rates""

The ""news"" in the saying refers to the moment that rumor becomes fact. When it becomes history. Old news. Tomorrow is that day. The cherry will have been popped.  Tomorrow will be the peak of the collective interest in interest rates. It will be front-page news. It will be the Super Bowl for gambling degenerates around the world.

THE SINGULARITY HAS BEGUN

  


  
I'm not sure if you're paying any fucking attention to what nerds are building these days. Let's look at a few examples: 

- To start, Waymo has solved self-driving. Tesla is on the cusp of doing the same

- Tesla and like 5 other companies are about to come out with actual fucking cyborgs. Robot slaves are almost here. Be sure to treat yours nicely. 

- People are already falling in love with chatbots (imagine cyborgs v2?)

- TSMC and Nvidia turn literal sand into rocks that can teach themselves anything 

- People want these magic rocks so bad that nuclear power has been resurrected from the dead so we can use the hot rocks to power the smart rocks

- Oh and OpenAI just dropped their new model o1, creating yet another way to turn more GPU cycles into more intelligence. Except this time, the algorithm is less efficient. A \*linear\* improvement with \*exponential\* increase in GPU/energy. Meaning demand for GPUs just ...shot up... again (sounds crazy, but I see at least a doubling here). Nvidia isn't the only beneficiary here, but I expect that capture 90% of this newly discovered demand (more on this in another post)

[$200 before the gopher sees his shadow](https://preview.redd.it/o5trxpcnhipd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6a067248a3b70438c6db77c81fa12e92603341)





POWELL IS A GENIUS

  


On to the main story of the day - what is Mr Pow-Pow gonna do? 

He's smart enough to understand that the stickiest part about inflation is housing. And no amount of low rates will ever solve housing. We can't choose to spend less on housing. Millenials and zoomers are fucking crammed in together. Housing has a supply issue. Not enough of it. And how is that solved? Build more. What does that cost? Money.

  
As paradoxical as it sounds, the solution to inflation has now become more money. We need construction to boom. Luckily, it is starting to. 

Powell also knows how to get a good price. How to ""stretch"" out his bps for the biggest societal changes.. Remember how skillfully he used the mere suggestion of rates drops to heat the economy up earlier this year. He got all that for 0 bps. 

So how can he get the most bang for his buck here? Start out with a bang. All else equal, a 50 bps now will create a bigger ""push"" of excitement through society than would two 25 bps back to back. He knows this. He'd rather give you 50 pbs now than 75 bps over 3. That's strategy - focussing on the war not the battle. So he creates a giant sigh of relief. He'll give us more up front. A nice little surprise from Santa Clause

Then the tapering will be slower than expected. That will get dialed back as the initial push shows to be effective. It'll be a classic Powell Tease. 

[HE'S BACK](https://preview.redd.it/0fl33yq1cipd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a7be47a5cf12cf2080edcbca884990130a774a)





THE GREAT ROTATION IS A MIRAGE





  
We are entering an Age of Great Monopolies. Yes, the S&P500 is concentrated. But look around - globalization and rapidly changing high-tech have made economies of scale that are completely unbeatable. The richest people in the world have hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the new normal. 

  
Are you really gonna drop Amazon...or Nvidia...just to scoop up companies that have higher debt, because now that debt is worth slightly less? You want banks ridden with corporate property debt and underwater T-bills? Amazon will have next hour delivery. Tesla is going to have i Robots. People are already falling in love with sex robots. 

  
The singularity is here. This is what it looks like. You may not like it but this is what peak acceleration looks like. That means you should be expecting exponential growth, and looking for companies going through it. Buy and hold or calls if you have too much money.

Given that China is already suspicious about western tech (as are we of China's) and basically after the 7th of October other big arab countries (UAE) have been very critical of Israel I think that these countries are gonna be very skeptical about buying more US products made in places like Taiwan. 

Even though Taiwan [denied that the pagers were made there](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/18/taiwan-dragged-into-middle-east-politics-after-deadly-pager-blasts) I'd be scarred if I was in a country that opposes Israel since they just proved that our own electronic devices can be made into lethal weapons. Basically they opened the door for many possible nightmarish scenarios. Imagine if your iPhone or NVIDIA GPU just explodes.

Anyway this might be a regarded thought but I'm interested in your responses.

No positions as of right now cuz I plan on losing money on rate cuts tonight.

'Twas the Night Before Rate Cuts,"'Twas the night before rate cuts, and all through the street,  
The regards all restless, in anticipation of heat.  

The bulls were all hopeful, their calls stacked with care,  
In hopes that ol' JPow would soon ease the scare.  

The bears held their breath, not trusting the game,  
They‚Äôd seen it before and knew who to blame.  

And I in my hoodie, the wife‚Äôs boyfriend on Zoom,  
Were glued to the charts as we sat in one room.  

When out on the web there arose such a flash,  
I closed my meme stocks, fearing a crash.  

I glanced at my screen, feeling jittery and raw,  
And there on the timeline‚Äîwhat I feared‚ÄîI saw.  

It was Powell and gang, in a frenzy no less,  
Discussing rate cuts, the markets a mess.  

‚ÄúCut by 25? Or maybe by 50?‚Äù  
Whispered the bulls, feeling quite nifty.  

But JPow just smirked as he held up hand,  
‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre in charge? You misunderstand.‚Äù  

‚ÄúThe cuts are coming, sure as you bet,  
But inflation‚Äôs a beast we haven‚Äôt tamed yet.‚Äù  

And I groaned as I watched, knowing what he would say,  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll buy the dip, but your gains fade away.‚Äù  

I stood by my screen, my face filled with doubt,  
""How can I win if he bails markets out?‚Äù  

He laughed as he left, and I knew in that flash,  
That even with rate cuts, I'd still lose my cash.  

So I sat down again, hand on my head,  
I‚Äôm just a regard, and Powell‚Äôs in our bed. ",2024-09-18,-0.296,0.8947,0.29935

It is my humble belief that J pow will bless us with a calm, confident, and data-focused .25 base point rate cut.

$EXAS - Exact Sciences,"**Exact Sciences (EXAS)** is a molecular diagnostics company primarily known for developing and manufacturing screening tests for cancer. Their most well-known product is Cologuard, a non-invasive, stool-based DNA test that screens for colon cancer and precancerous polyps. It‚Äôs widely used as an alternative to traditional colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening.

In addition to Cologuard, Exact Sciences also focuses on developing other diagnostic tests for early cancer detection, particularly in areas like breast, liver, and lung cancer. They emphasize molecular and genomic technologies to advance precision medicine in oncology.

Recently, Exact Sciences has been making headlines due to its advancements in cancer diagnostics, particularly with its efforts to develop a blood-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test. In mid-September 2024, the company presented promising data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, showing that their new blood test has a sensitivity of 88.3% for colorectal cancer and 31.2% for advanced precancerous lesions. This innovation could potentially serve as a non-invasive alternative to current tests, expanding CRC screening to millions of unscreened individuals.

Additionally, Exact Sciences is working on a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, which showed an overall sensitivity of 54.8% for cancers without standard screening options and 63.7% for the most aggressive cancers. The company aims to submit its blood-based CRC test to the FDA by 2025, marking a significant step forward in non-invasive cancer screening options.

These innovations are positioning Exact Sciences as a leader in the diagnostic field, with broad implications for cancer detection and prevention.

Several large pharmaceutical and biotech companies could be potential acquirers of Exact Sciences due to its leadership in the cancer diagnostics space, particularly with its successful Cologuard test and promising pipeline in blood-based cancer screenings. Some of the potential acquirers could include:

**Pfizer:** Pfizer has been looking to diversify its portfolio and expand its oncology pipeline, making it a strong candidate. It already has a collaboration history with Exact Sciences, as Pfizer once had a marketing partnership for Cologuard.

**Roche:** Roche, a global leader in diagnostics, might be interested in Exact Sciences due to its complementary diagnostic technologies, particularly in early cancer detection and precision medicine.

**Abbott Laboratories:** Abbott, a giant in the medical devices and diagnostics field, could see strategic value in acquiring Exact Sciences to strengthen its position in cancer diagnostics and leverage synergies with its own diagnostic platforms.

**Thermo Fisher Scientific:** Thermo Fisher, which has a strong focus on genomics and molecular diagnostics, could be interested in acquiring Exact Sciences to further its expansion into cancer diagnostics and early detection.

**Illumina:** As a leader in sequencing technologies, Illumina could consider buying Exact Sciences to expand its footprint in early cancer detection, particularly as both companies have overlapping interests in genomic diagnostics and precision medicine.

The all-time high for Exact Sciences (EXAS) stock occurred on January 18, 2021, when it reached a peak price of $159.54 per share.

This surge came amid strong growth in its cancer screening business, particularly with the success of its Cologuard test and expectations surrounding its pipeline of new diagnostic products.

The pipeline hungry giants could easily justify a 10x current sales ratio. At $2.5 billion in current revenue that would place a buyout at $25 billion.  Less $2.4 billion in debt that is 22.5 billion for equity. At 184.77 million shares outstanding that is approximately $121.77 per share. Or 77% upside.

Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points¬†**(**[**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)**).**

***Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179***

Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars‚Äô worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a computer revolution,‚Äù Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a skill.

Huang also emphasized the need for ‚Äúdensification,‚Äù with NVIDIA Corp¬†(NASDAQ:NVDA)¬†aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp‚Äôs (NASDAQ:NVDA)¬†new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.

Nvidia‚Äôs declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.

Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.

At Nvidia‚Äôs GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America‚Äôs Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.

Of course, Nvidia won‚Äôt dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia‚Äôs data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion‚Äîless than half of the total market‚Äîbut still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its¬†[**Q2 2024 investor letter**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/heres-why-nvidia-corporation-nvda-appreciated-in-q2-1346747/):

First half of this year, I was skeptical of the market and had quit my job, so I didn't touch my accounts. 

Then, I decided to experiment with options. I started small, trying to apply my investment lessons to longer-term monthlies (4-6 mo expiry). It went pretty well, for a while, made a bunch off the rotation trade into small-caps and consumer discretionary. Got caught a little by wide bid/ask spreads, and a bad entry on the NVDA rebound, but nothing too bad. 

Then I had the brilliant idea to try intraday trading weeklies. No 0 DTE, because Fidelity (thank you broker). Tried trading MA crossovers like a regard, then tried some trend-following using VWAP.

CME FedWatch Tool Methodology is Flawed. 0.50% rate cut is not going to happen.,"TL;DR: CME tool says 67% chance of 50bps rate reduction, I believe this number is closer to 50%. CME tool says 0% chance of rates staying the same, I believe this number is closer to 20%. 

At the moment, this is what you see when you go to the fedwatch [website](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html):

[100% chance of rate reduction!](https://i.imgur.com/J53yE08.png)

They sure do seem very confident don't they? With a 67% chance of a 0.50% rate reduction, seems excessive?

If you read into the methodology, you'll see that it's by design that there are only two options. The FedWatch calculation looks at what futures are trading at, and simplistically allocates a probability to the two closest 25bps. This is at best, an oversimplification, and at worst, misleading and wrong data. It's no surprise that these predictions have been so consistently wrong in the past few years.

Not to bore you all with the large details, but in short using a bit of high school stats you can come up with some more sensible figures:
[See here](https://i.imgur.com/QvA1AJ1.png)

As you can see, I believe there's roughly a 20% chance of no rate reduction, which makes sense. It's unlikely rates will stay flat, but to say there's 0% chance is misleading. A miss in inflation, unemployment, or other data could lead the FOMC to not reduce monetary policy.

The graph is slightly out of date (bond and futures market move quick!) but you can see that a 50bps reduction is closer to 50% (i.e. a coinflip) rather than the 67% being quoted by CME (2/3 chance).

Some more info on my methodology for anyone interested:

The current methodology of calculating the probability of changes to the Fed's fund target rate only allows for two options

This is evident ahead of the FOMC meeting on the 18th of September, where there is likely to be 1 to 2 rate reductions (graph on left)

However, my main concern is the fact that the calculation and therefore the tables indicate that there is a 0% chance rates staying (or even being hiked)

Whilst this is unlikely, the probability is not 0%. Therefore, showing such simplistic probabilities is misleading, and investors/traders may not be fully informed.

I've suggested a method which doesn't rely on any additional assumptions, using the Poisson Distribution, where the average number of rate cuts is calculated in the same manner.

TL;DR: CME tool says 67% chance of 50bps rate reduction, I believe this number is closer to 50%. CME tool says 0% chance of rates staying the same, I believe this number is closer to 20%

So why is big money making this false narrative? What's in it for them? I doubt this is about tricking retail investors. What's the angle?

Also, the Fed will release the dot plot this week showing future interest rate predictions for the next 2+ years, which is what will actually move the market.

$ARKG The Ultimate Rate Cut Play,"Following on from my [$BNTX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cy0tfp/bntx_17b_cash_with_no_debt_huge_pipeline_news/) idea posted earlier in the year, which whilst being early played out beautifully and the mis pricing of [$RKLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cwku7q/rklb_everybody_left_as_the_party_gets_started/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) options which also played out beautifully, I feel the rates cuts, pending catalysts and extreme hate towards cathie woods could fuel a Genomic rally.

[Weekly chart of ARKG, Via TC200](https://preview.redd.it/3drgn26sy4pd1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbc4b60c50d22b405efe9b63f0afca0e5b78b06)

It‚Äôs no secret that the market has been pricing in the potential September rate cut in many sectors, considering it will be the first in 4 years. The thesis is, this will inevitably lead investors into taking on more risk in speculative names in search of higher yields. It also lowers the payments for companies/sectors that rely heavily on debt to fuel growth. It plays a big role in the IWM thesis and it‚Äôs potential to finally begin a bull run. Whilst IWM and other sectors are already pricing in this potential move and their respective option chains getting juiced, there are many still that have been forgotten.

As of late we‚Äôve seen names like $BNTX $SMMT and many more start to break out in an aggressive manner. With XBI heading back towards 52 week highs and individual names such as $BEAM $CRSP $RXRX all pivoting on Friday with BEAM + 7.75%, $NTLA + 6.24% and CRSP 6.41%; many of their options chains are getting juiced/expensive. Which is hardly surprising, as a lot of the genomic names post huge updates in the coming weeks and rate cuts are incredibly bullish for the sector.

[XBI \(Biotech\) Preparing for a monthly bull flag breakout.](https://preview.redd.it/e8o1sby8f5pd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=473f54ac08af471c8b4a137de91f20d9aa638048)

However, thanks to the hate towards cathie woods right now and her entire list of funds, $ARKG, which contains all of the names above and more has been left behind. In fact, the fund has a 30% sI against it which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make. This is the exact same thing I noticed with $BNTX, it had been totally forgotten, leaving the options to become extremely cheap, until everybody wanted in of course.

I have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have, their short floats, fund positioning and when data is likely to be released. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts on Wednesday, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.

Biotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even as AI continues to show signs of massively helping the industry. Cathie wood has become one of the most hated and laughed at fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn‚Äôt being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.

In the last couple of weeks we‚Äôre actually seeing institutional inflow into ARKG and many of the individual holdings themselves, which suggests a potential turning point is on the horizon.

[Fund positioning of ARKG, via Fintel.](https://preview.redd.it/nfm7cahyy4pd1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=f878575fcd3313f072d858e15d65926c2e0e4000)

The genomic sector is complex and very few understand the intricate details of each company. $ARKG is therefore the easiest way for many to get exposure, as money piles in it pushes the individual holdings higher causing a covering in individual holdings and the underlying securities, creating a snowball effect.

Once this even begins to take place I‚Äôm expecting to see a surge in IV and essentially ARKG options priced much more aggressively. Biotech is known for huge and oversized moves thanks to the very difficult nature of pricing the underlying security. I‚Äôm expecting this to happen in the next couple of days.

Last Call on Applovin,"A ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù onto retail has been prepped for quite some time. If there was a time to tighten the grip on long positions, I believe that now would be the time.

Things the politically correct  way of putting things:

Investor Concerns Mount Over Applovin (APP) Amid Lawsuits, Insider Sell-offs, and Questionable Fundamentals

[Palo Alto, Ca] ‚Äì Applovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) is facing heightened scrutiny from investors, particularly retail traders, due to ongoing legal battles, insider selling activity, and questions surrounding the company‚Äôs long-term growth strategy. These concerns come at a time when Applovin is promoting its business aggressively through public relations campaigns, while several shareholder lawsuits and investigations raise critical red flags.

Growth in Revenue Overshadowed by Structural Weaknesses

In its Q2 2024 earnings report, Applovin announced revenue growth of $1.08 billion and generated $446 million in free cash flow, signaling strong operational performance. However, the mobile gaming market, which forms the backbone of Applovin‚Äôs revenue, is experiencing slower growth. The company‚Äôs expansion into e-commerce advertising‚Äîa promising vertical‚Äîis still in its pilot phase, with meaningful contributions not expected until 2025  .

Insider Activity Raises Investor Alarms

In recent months, insiders have sold significant portions of their Applovin shares, raising concerns about the company‚Äôs long-term outlook. SEC filings reveal that insiders have sold shares worth millions, with major sell-offs occurring around key price milestones and vesting periods . With a substantial portion of the company‚Äôs stock controlled by hedge funds, index funds, and insiders, retail investors are questioning whether these large shareholders are aligned with their interests.

Lawsuits Amplify Investor Skepticism

Applovin is also embroiled in a series of legal challenges, including the Mitchell vs. Applovin case, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty and misleading statements by the company. Shareholder lawsuits like this are focused on whether Applovin‚Äôs leadership failed to disclose critical risks, further undermining investor confidence  . Additionally, investigations by firms such as Schall Law and Purcell & Lefkowitz LLP are examining whether Applovin issued false or misleading statements that could have contributed to investor losses .

Profitability in Question Amid Legal and Business Challenges

While Applovin boasts impressive EBITDA margins of 81%, the company‚Äôs future profitability is under pressure. Expected margin compression in the core app segment and slower user acquisition growth signal potential headwinds. Combined with the looming legal risks and insider selling, these factors raise doubts about the company‚Äôs ability to sustain its current financial performance .

Conclusion: Caution Urged for Investors

With the convergence of legal risks, insider profit-taking, and potential structural weaknesses, investors are encouraged to proceed with caution. The aggressive PR push promoting Applovin‚Äôs business may not reflect the full picture, as lawsuits and shareholder concerns grow louder. Retail investors, in particular, should consider these factors when evaluating Applovin‚Äôs long-term investment prospects.

Gold & Silver  $$$   Inelastic Supply vs Asymmetric Demand   $$$   Market Internals for Sunday Night September 15th 2024 Part 1,"[WSB DD PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ep7fbe/the_precious_metals_sector_is_in_a_stealth_bull/)

[WSB DD PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ey7d8i/gold_sector_internals_update_for_wednesday_august/)

I'll (try to) keep this concise.  First of all Gold is in a full blown bull market and headed much higher in the coming years.  I laid out the fundamentals in the links above.  If that is true (that gold is in a full fledged bull market) it normally holds true that Silver starts to out perform at some point and that process may have already started.  The drivers for the precious metals are straight forward 

* 35T of debt in the present
* 200T of debt in the future
* 200T of derivatives in the US banking system
* Asset rotation from growth/tech to value/commodities
* Yield curve steepening (after longest inversion in history), unemployment rising
* London (LBMA) and COMEX under pressure
* Geopolitical risks, war cycle, BRICS meeting this October regarding gold backing
* Basal III allows central banks to hold tier-1 asset gold at full value 
* India and China buying up physical silver, no one in the west owns any yet, solar sector and solar technology developments bullish to compete for annual silver supply against investment demand

I should stop there.  

First I want to take a look at the Silver to Gold ratio.  It's been out of whack for a while and I think I know why.  I'll put that in part 2.

Betting against JP Morgan and also buying calls on Victoria secret ,"Firstly, about JP Morgan.

This is a bank we all know, some hate them some love them. However, I am just here for the money.

From the 2008 crisis to the effect of COVID and the current bearish thesis of Jamie Dimon. I believe he knows something. 

But in that case why did he not shorten JP Morgan investment strategy? Jp Morgan bank has high leverage, long term investments, and with the capital requirement from the government it is logical to see the price fall.

Rate cut is generally not beneficial for banks. Banks make money from the difference of cost and profit trading from its users and lower rate means lower fee.

My idea is Jamie believes the market is going down either way and all he can do is diversified investments, lay off but the decline in the short-term is inevitable.

Forget the Kelly Criterion: YOLO Everything,"Who has time for caution? Why waste precious moonshot opportunities by only betting 10% of your portfolio when you can go all in and ride the rocket? Sure, the Kelly Criterion might give you some mathematical comfort, but let‚Äôs be real, this isn‚Äôt a spreadsheet simulation. This is the wild west of Wall Street, and you don‚Äôt get ahead by hedging bets and taking ‚Äúsensible‚Äù risks.



Honestly, if you‚Äôre only betting 10% on that once-in-a-lifetime trade, you might as well not even bother. The whole point is to make generational wealth, not crawl your way to modest gains. 10% gains? Enviable gains? Nah, we're talking about flipping entire portfolios here. You‚Äôre not in this for a ‚Äúsensible capital allocation‚Äù you‚Äôre in this to YOLO it all and come out on top.

And yeah, I hear the caution about that 1% scenario where you lose everything. Guess what? That‚Äôs the game. This isn‚Äôt some safety net strategy for the faint-hearted. Go big, or go home. If you‚Äôre gonna play Russian Roulette, don‚Äôt worry about how many barrels are in the revolver just pull the damn trigger. If you're worried about a ""pending recession,"" then you‚Äôre already losing.



You know what‚Äôs even worse than losing? Watching something moon while you sit on the sidelines clutching your Kelly Criterion spreadsheet, kicking yourself for not going all in. Because when your bets don‚Äôt land, you‚Äôll be just as broke whether you risked 10% or 100%, so might as well swing for the fences.

If you‚Äôre really that scared of losing, you‚Äôre not built for this game. But if you‚Äôre here to make the history books, it‚Äôs time to put it all on the line. Don‚Äôt Google ‚ÄúKelly Criterion.‚Äù Google ‚Äúhow to live like a legend.‚Äù

"Balance before the storm, the week ahead.","MANY DOUBTED MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE BUT MOST OF MY CALLS WERE PERFECT: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fbgpyh/why_the_market_bottomed_on_friday_a_technical/

# What's next?

## Balance before the storm

Yes, I know there are always a few out there who scoffed at my bullish calls last week. I get it‚Äîyou‚Äôve been conditioned by fear, anxiety, and headlines screaming about recessions and doom. But while you‚Äôve been stuck in your perpetual state of ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt last,‚Äù the market has entered a phase of equilibrium. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are losing steam, and we‚Äôre sitting at the tipping point.

This week, the S&P 500 (SPX) will likely go nowhere‚Äîgive or take a measly 0.5%. But within that broad stillness, there are opportunities. As I said before, I'm still holding onto my $600 call for Meta by 11/11, and now, I‚Äôve added a $250 call for Tesla as well. Why? Because the setups for these two stocks are that compelling, and anyone betting against them is simply ignoring the writing on the wall. But there's more brewing this week, including an under-the-radar SMCI catalyst and the geopolitical noise that never seems to let up. Let‚Äôs dig in.

### The Bulls Are Ready, The Bears Are Tired
We‚Äôre entering a rare moment of balance this week. The bears, after months of trying to claw the market down, are losing momentum. It‚Äôs no surprise‚Äîtheir thesis was built on inflation fears, rate hikes, and market collapses that have yet to materialize in any significant way. Sure, the economic data is mixed, and yes, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs game of chicken with the economy continues. But in reality, the worst-case scenarios haven‚Äôt played out. And the bulls? They‚Äôre rested, ready, and growing stronger by the day.

This week, expect the SPX to consolidate. +/- 0.5%, at most, as the market digests the ongoing news flow. It‚Äôs a classic tug-of-war situation, where the opposing sides are evenly matched. Bulls have been fortified by recent strength in big tech (Meta, Tesla), while bears are nursing wounds from failed short positions. It‚Äôs a delicate balance‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be surprised if the scale tips toward a breakout soon. My bets are positioned accordingly.

### Meta: The $600 Target Is Alive
First up, Meta. Let‚Äôs be real, if you didn‚Äôt already jump on this train when I first mentioned it, you‚Äôre already behind. Last week, Meta continued to show relative strength, outperforming even in a market that‚Äôs trying to catch its breath. And the setup only looks better going forward. The metaverse, digital advertising recovery, and AI momentum‚ÄîMeta has all the catalysts to reach $600 by 11/11. If you're still doubting this, you clearly haven't been watching the technicals. Momentum is on our side.

I‚Äôm still holding onto my $600C, and if the market gives us any pullback this week, I‚Äôll probably add more. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.

### Tesla: Charging Towards $250
As for Tesla, my new $250 call is straightforward. Tesla has been trading in a tight range, coiling like a spring. When Tesla consolidates like this, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the breakout happens, and I‚Äôm betting that it‚Äôs going to be upward. Between the continued push into EV dominance, Elon‚Äôs ongoing antics that somehow keep Tesla in the headlines, and institutional money that loves to chase momentum, Tesla is primed.

Look, Tesla has defied gravity for years, and its ability to move with news-driven momentum is second to none. With nothing but green skies ahead, $250 feels conservative. I‚Äôll happily ride the wave higher.

### SMCI: The Under-the-Radar Winner
Now, let‚Äôs talk about SMCI. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on this one for a while, and with their 10K expected this week, I‚Äôm looking to load up on some calls before the release. This is one of those quiet setups where the risk/reward ratio is too good to pass up. SMCI has been steadily gaining traction, and while it‚Äôs not plastered across every financial news headline, the fundamentals speak for themselves.

Once that 10K drops, I expect the stock to move, and those of us who were paying attention beforehand are going to profit. Watch closely here‚Äîdon‚Äôt sleep on it.

### The Noise: Futures Rollovers, FOMC, and Geopolitical Drama
Of course, no week is complete without some good old-fashioned chaos. Futures are rolling over this week, which means we could see some positioning shifts from the big players. This always adds an extra layer of volatility, especially when you combine it with the Fed‚Äôs looming FOMC meeting. Everyone will be dissecting Jerome Powell‚Äôs every word, as always, but if you‚Äôve been watching carefully, you‚Äôll notice a softer tone from the Fed. They‚Äôre trying to engineer a soft landing, and while I have my doubts about their precision, the market is liking what it hears.

Then there‚Äôs the elephant in the room: Mango. There are ripple effects from the latest developments in his ongoing legal saga, with new speculation swirling about potential international involvement. Ukraine? Russia? Who knows at this point, but geopolitical uncertainty always adds a little spice to the market‚Äôs reaction. Throw in the fact that no one can seem to locate Ms.Plan ‚Äîwhere is it?

### Final Thoughts: Keep Betting on Winners
In summary, this week might be flat for the broader market, but there are pockets of opportunity for those who know where to look. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are weakening, and we‚Äôre at a moment of equilibrium. But don‚Äôt get lulled into complacency. Meta and Tesla are leading the charge, and SMCI is gearing up to surprise everyone. Meanwhile, the political and economic noise will continue to distract the masses. Stay focused on the winners, and you‚Äôll be the one laughing at the doubters in the end.

Case for positive SP500 following rate cuts,"The short answer to ‚ÄúWhat will happen when the Fed Cuts rates?‚Äù is that it depends, however in the below article from Fidelity, they make a pretty strong case for a strong next 12 months following the upcoming rate cuts.

While the short term can still be volatile and could see a decline, they point out the following 3 things that bode well for equities:

1. Earnings growth continues to remain strong and as the cost to borrow $ goes down, that should help companies boost growth even more

2. Historically, the gap we currently have between where the Fed rate is at vs current inflation levels has correlated with an average of 14% returns‚Äî this is based on data starting in 1962.

3. The combination of rates falling with an acceleration of Leading Economic indicators and an increase is Bank‚Äôs willingness to lend (which are all occurring) has also lead to an average of +17% and +15% returns, respectively 

This isn‚Äôt investment advice and there is always the chance of a black swan event or major changes to current data, but at least something to consider as you plan your moves.

"For the love of god, google ""Kelly Criterion""","It doesn't matter if you are 99% sure that your YOLO will moon because of the transit of Uranus or something. It's heartbreaking to see people posting losses amounting to years of savings, I was also seriously considering a YOLO on long SPY puts until I came across this concept because I'm feeling super sure about a pending recession. Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).

The gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.

If you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.

Microsoft Bubble?,"So, I‚Äôve been kicking this around, and I figured you guys would be the best judge of it.

Is there a Microsoft ‚ÄòBubble‚Äô (I dunno if I‚Äôm using that right, it feels weird). Anyway, here‚Äôs my thinking?

At what point do AAA games start marketing you microtransactions? From the very start, they‚Äôre that valuable. So, what does that mean for the RRP? It has lesser value than microtransactions. Played out, there‚Äôs a break-even point where forgoing the RRP altogether will still be worth it. Are we seeing that already, faithful reader?

The cutthroat efficiency of capitalism will mean that the endgame will be all games. Free. Forever.

So where does that leave Xbox and game pass? I‚Äôll ask you a better question. What does that mean for the ‚Äòx as a service‚Äô model?

You buy Disney+, do you pay 5 on top for the Mandalorian?

This is the endgame of capitalism. It‚Äôs efficiency is too ruthless. It is cannibalising its customers. Everything in the software service will cede to microtransactions. Service models will become redundant.

So, yeah, short Microsoft. Tips welcome.

Why November fed rate decision is more important than Sept,"Since Sept federal rate decision is already priced into the market and the 0.5% rate cut seems improbable, the major kicker will be the November rate decision. If Fed decides to hold it depending on election results (though Powell keeps saying he is an apolitical decision maker and he pretty much lying there) and the rate are held steady instead of a cut, I expect a deep dip in the market. Hence I have short term calls on SPY that expire September and ling term puts that expire December. 

Now you might ask why would fed hold it steady in November - my calc says we have not stabilized inflation and job market will remain strong due to holiday season with seasonal labor increase and extensive spending during the holiday season. There will be no metric that will help Fed lean towards the 0.75% to 1.25% rate cut expected for all of 2024. It will be a debacle. The next rate cut is in 2025 folks.

Intel is a good buy,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs.

That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. 

None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. 

On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed?

As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel.

Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West. Also, Intel shares are below $20 a pop right now. Do what you will with this info. ",2024-09-15,0.4404,0.9696,0.7050000000000001

And such was the case for the first week, until the market decided to recover almost to the exact same point it was when it left August.

I missed out on an extremely valuable post showing market performance on 9/11 and even though I went with calls that morning they were decimated before the market did a big JUST KIDDING WATCH ME MOVE to reverse everything and go on a solid run to close the week.

I will be buying puts from here until the end of the month, in smaller batches and DCAing when needed. Praying for some volatility and another reversal of the reversal of the reversal. First week was red, 2nd week green, major indices are showing a 4-6 day green run and I believe it will relinquish it back. RSI is picking up not into super overbought territory but we all know the market is not really showing how frail the economy is with regards to consumer spend/debt and stability.

"Listen regards, my next speculation is $COST will split and rip.","I'm the degenerate that bought way OTM calls on $DG and $DLTR because $1 stores are trash and the options were cheap lotto tickets. How you find these plays; get a thesis going, then check for lottery tickets, then manage your risk. 

The play? The deepest OTM calls on $COST, at various strikes and dates as follows:  


10/4 1040c for $1.67/each  
10/18 1200c for $0.40/each  
12/20 1300c for $0.69/each.  
  
I started earlier this week with the 980 and 990 calls, but they were up 80% and 33% respectively, so I sold those and loaded up on the above. 

I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you're fucking stupid"". A little, but besides the point. Here's the thesis. 

1) Its fucking Costco. Just look at that chart. Speaking of chart?  
2) $COST is the $NVDA of grocery stores, essentially. Better and better every year, since they both opened. Well run companies, good products and financials, blah blah blah. Why compare to NVDA? The split.   
3) The strikes on the options chains. DG was a play because the 100p were cheap and was a critical level on the chart. DLTR on the other hand? **Yes, the 65p was also at a key level on the chart. But 65 was the lowest strike on the chain.** 

Think about it. If the stock prices goes higher (or lower) than the highest (or lowest) strike on the chain, the people writing those options have **NO** hedge. 

How? Well, not everyone is a degenerate monkey like we all are. They hedge, instead of zero to hero shit. 

For those unfamiliar with options, here's the ELI5 of it. I write (sell to open) an option, I collect the premium (price paid per contract). I get the money; you get the contract. Contract expires, dope, I get 'free' money. Contract goes ITM, I'm boned, now I have to buy or sell 100 shares to fulfill the contract. At a loss. An example. 

Say I think WMT will go down by next Friday, to $75. WMT is now $80.60/share. 

So, I write a 75c for WMT (sell to open) that expires 9/20 and collect \~$6.10 in premium. 1 of 3 things will happen. 

1) WMT hits $75, or below by 9/20. Instead of $5 ITM, it is barely ITM and only worth $1.06/contract. So, I buy one of the contracts for $1.06 to ""buy to close"". Sold it for $6.10, bought it back for $1.06, I keep the $5.04 in extra premium in my pocket.

2) Stock price does nothing, pretty much all week. The option is still $5 ITM by Friday, but worth less than the $6.10 I wrote it for on Monday. Price is still the same, but now there is less than 24 hours to expiration instead of 5 days. You buy to close the same option back for $3-4, still collect $1-2 in premium. 

3) WMT rips to $85, now the option you wrote is $10 ITM and is worth $10. Either it gets exercised and you lose money, or you buy to open another contract for $10 and still lose money.  

So, how do you hedge for the possibility of scenario 3? You buy the 80c for $1.06 roughly. If WMT does rip to $85 that week, yes the 75c you wrote is worth $10 instead of $5. But the 80c you bought as a hedge for $1.06 is now $5 ITM and is worth the same $5 you lost on the contract you wrote. That is the hedge

  
Why bring all of this up like I have any idea of what I'm talking about? 

**Well, what happens when the $75 is the highest strike on the options chain? You can't buy the 80c for a hedge, because it does not exist.** 

That is where the play comes in. If COST posts good ER (usually do because they're COST, and increased membership so money money) **AND** they announce a split on their 9/26 ER? This thing absolutely rips. 

**IF** this happens, $1100 is my price target by 10/4. 

**This is a BIG IF so position yourself with money you are comfortable seeing go to ZERO.**

But if this does work? We can all buy our own Wendy's. 

Let us assume that this play works as I'm imagining it and COST hits $1050-$1100/share by 10/4.   
  
- The 10/4 1040c will be $10-60 ITM, \~$17.50-$52.50/each up from $1.67/each  
- The 10/18 1200c will be $100-150 OTM instead of $280 OTM. Hard to estimate from options chain, but definitely worth more than the 0.40/each we buy them for. And, by 10/18, those could possibly even be ITM also.   
- The 12/20 1300c will also be worth more than we paid for them. 

I'll post my positions below in a photo, with some charts. 

This is my next play, and I'm putting up 10% of my capital at risk on it. 

If you only want one option to keep track of, go with the 10/4 1040c for sure. 

Currently, they are $1.67/each. **START a position, don't fucking load up on them all at once! Risk only what you're willing to see go to ZERO.**

So, whatever 1% of your capital is. Risk that and start the position on Monday. Whether that is 1, 10, or 100 contracts. Fuck it. Only 1-2% of your capital. 

After that, watch and observe. Options go down and value and are less than $1.67/each? Then add more. This is what I will be doing, until the total of the bet accounts for 10% of my bankroll. 5% if you want to be conservative, but I'm risking 10% on this one. 

***tl;dr: I'm regarded and think COST will do a stock split, and will rip past 1060 (to put options writers in an awkward and unhedged position). $COST will rip to $1100 by 10/4, and the 1040c will be $1-$60 ITM.

"Prognosis ER , freight me FDX down below , see chart","FedEx is set to report its earnings for Q3 2024 on September 19th, following the market close. The current consensus for earnings per share (EPS) is projected at $4.87, with expected revenue reaching approximately $21.93 billion. As always, market participants will be closely watching the company's guidance to better gauge future performance, as clarity here will be essential for setting expectations moving forward.

While I don't possess the ability to predict outcomes with certainty, I can offer insights based on a technical analysis of the chart.

For instance, consider the price action on December 19, 2023, a Tuesday, when FedEx stock reached a high of $285. Despite the initial upward momentum, the market found no acceptance at that price level, leading to a breakdown following the earnings report. Similarly, on March 22, 2024 (Friday), the stock surged upward, once again testing the $285-$289 range. However, as the auction process failed to establish sustained acceptance at this level, the price declined shortly afterward.

Most notably, the earnings report on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, left a significant gap on the chart. According to technical principles such as gap theory, it‚Äôs likely that the price action in upcoming sessions will aim to retest the lower levels and potentially fill the gap that was created.",2024-09-15,0.0,0.7819,0.39095
30k into Cava shorts,"Just a lil yolo & DD to see how far we can go with this, Cava is a mediterranean salad bar style restaurant that has been on a monster run over the past year but is currently trading at an outrageous share price. It generates around 30 million per quarter and has 350 locations YET its share price reflects each of these locations is worth around 37 million dollars. So do they add gold flakes to each salad or give each customer a happy finish after meal? Short answer is NO. They are a common place restaurant in a super competitive industry that offers nothing other than another hyped up growth story and a phat PE that would make any sane bear hard as a üíé. On top of this very in depth DD is the fact multiple insiders have been dumping consistently since there last ER. The CEO was also on Jim Cramer trying to pump up his over priced salad bar chain this last Friday so i figured that was the o ting on the cake and perfect time to short & got in Friday morning.

Stonkz only go Uppies?,"Sup regards,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn‚Äôt act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

VIX and FOMC DD,"Positions 127 UVIX 9/20 6c at $0.14 average. I plan to halve on the double and then assess an exit plan for the rest, or more likely, I‚Äôll just mess it all up and lose money.

Update on position: I sold all but 20 contracts for 21¬¢ and I‚Äôll keep an eye on the rest this week, probably let them expire worthless and just treat them like a lottery ticket. 50% gain on the 107 other contracts isn‚Äôt too shabby IMO.

Update 2: I sold the last 20 for 18¬¢ and I‚Äôm fully out of the position. I plan to monitor and possibly re-enter the trade closer to 10¬¢ or at a lower strike. I‚Äôve traded a chance at huge gains for some guaranteed and decent profits. Good luck everyone, I plan to update this post if I make another related trade. 

Update 3: my next entry target is UVIX 9/20 5c at 20¬¢

TLDR, I think the VIX is too low with the recent market volatility, uncertainty about FOMC rate decision and other central bank rate decisions. I‚Äôve attempted to use ChatGPT to analyze VIX and long vol ETF movement around other FOMC meetings. For whatever reason, it stops at September 2023. I‚Äôm not sure how useful or accurate this info is, but it sure makes my confirmation bias feel warm and fuzzy.

PACS: Prestige acquisition finalized so earnings will soar,"PACS operates skilled nursing facilities in the western US.¬† The company had its IPO in April of this year and is up 77% since then.¬† But it‚Äôs still undervalued.

PACS generally leases facilities. They pay rent, taxes, maintenance and wages.¬† Revenue comes from insurance reimbursement based on number of residents and services provided to those residents.

The largest 9 skilled nursing facility (SNF) operators only manage 11% of total SNFs in the USA.¬† This means that the vast majority of SNFs are managed by small operators or are individually owned.¬† Some of these facilities are well run and efficient, but many of them aren‚Äôt.¬† So, there are incredible opportunities for large operators, like PACS, that can take over leases of poorly run facilities and greatly improve income.¬† These turnarounds generally take around 18 months.¬†¬†

ENSG is another company in the same business as PACS.¬† ENSG is up around 1000% in 10 years.¬† This just shows that there‚Äôs a lot of potential in SNF consolidation.

PACS announced, just this week, that they finalized a huge acquisition. ¬† [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910499494/en/PACS-Group-Extends-Footprint-Services-to-Pacific-Northwest-and-Other-States](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910499494/en/PACS-Group-Extends-Footprint-Services-to-Pacific-Northwest-and-Other-States) They have now taken over operations of Prestige Care‚Äôs entire SNF portfolio: 53 facilities.¬† PACS operated 220 facilities before the acquisition, so this is a 24% increase in facility count.¬†¬†

The 53 new facilities are mostly located in the Pacific Northwest: near Portland and in Washington state.¬† I was able to find occupancy data for most of the new facilities from CMS.¬† I calculated an average occupancy rate of only 69%.¬† According to the most recent 10-Q report, PACS has an occupancy rate of 94% for all facilities they have managed for more than 18 months.¬† Based on this: occupancy, revenue and earnings should all greatly improve for the 53 new facilities in upcoming quarters.

A high percentage of new facilities (operated for less than 18 months) indicates greater potential for earnings growth.¬† Before the acquisition, 65 out of 220 (29%) PACS facilities were new.¬† Now 118 out of 273 facilities (43%) are new.

Potential labor shortages, and especially skilled labor shortages are important to consider when forecasting how quickly PACS can turnaround the 53 new facilities.¬† The availability of nurses and other healthcare professionals varies greatly by region.¬† Rural areas generally have much more difficulty finding and keeping nurses.¬†¬†

The 53 new facilities are mostly located near major cities like Portland and Seattle. We would expect staffing to be much less of a problem than if they were mostly located in rural areas.¬† And job openings on PACS careers website backs that up.¬† I checked openings for as many of the 53 new facilities that I could find.¬† Total number of openings (including cleaners, meal prep, etc.) at each facility was generally in the single digits.¬† Nurse openings were mostly around 3 per facility.¬†

Average total staff at SNFs is 150 to 200 employees and average number of Registered nurses is around 15-20 (according to Meta AI anyway).¬† So the job openings at the new facilities probably only represent a small portion of total staff.

Only 1 of the 53 facilities appeared to be having great difficulty finding qualified staff: a facility in Carson City Nevada that was offering sign-on bonuses for nurses.¬† While in many rural areas of the country, sign-on bonuses and other incentives are the norm.¬† My point is staffing problems are not likely to limit occupancy and earnings growth at the 53 new facilities.

**Facility shortage**

The pandemic caused construction of new facilities to slow dramatically.¬† First covid increased the death rate, which decreased occupancy directly and also decreased new admissions because facilities were viewed (correctly) as too dangerous.¬† Then, a severe labor shortage greatly affected the elderly care industry because it is very labor intensive.¬† Because the elderly care industry was so troubled, investors did not want to risk capital on new construction projects.¬† And construction still has not recovered, even with the first baby boomers approaching the age of 80.¬† New facilities construction rate is at its lowest level since 2014. Analysts are now projecting a shortage of 500,000 individual units for the elderly by 2030.¬†¬†

And that shortage is probably going to be worse than what analysts are currently projecting.¬† Death rates will be lower because of a herd-thinning effect in 2020-22.¬† Many more frail people died in those years than normal leaving a relatively more robust population.¬† USA death rates for the elderly were around 8% lower than expected levels in July.¬† This lower than expected death rate for the elderly is likely to continue for many months and years.¬†¬†

Also, dementia rates are increasing because much of the population suffered at least some degree of brain injury from covid.¬† Here‚Äôs what is happening in the UK, where they are tracking the rates: [https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/07/dementia-diagnoses-in-england-at-record-high/](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/07/dementia-diagnoses-in-england-at-record-high/)

So both of these factors are going to further strain Elderly care facilities and increase occupancy.¬† This benefits nursing home operators, like PACS, directly because occupancy rates will increase more quickly.¬† But it also means medicaid & medicare must keep reimbursement rates high to incentivize the construction and operation of new units.

**Valuation**

PACS revenue growth is very strong at 29.1% and I think this is likely to continue or accelerate due to their new acquisitions.Their earnings growth is a bit difficult to figure out because they just had their IPO and there were a lot of expenses related to that. Net income was $38.2 million in first 6 months of 2024 vs. $58.8 million for first 6 months of 2023.¬† But if you adjust for the one time expenses (on page 35 of their most recent 10-Q), I get earnings of $124.5million for first 6 months of 2024 vs $62.6 million for first 6 months of 2023.¬† This gives 98% earnings growth.¬†

For earnings per share, I get: ($124.5million\*2)/129 million shares = 1.93.¬† Current price is 40.72 so for trailing PE ratio I get 21.1.¬† And for PEG ratio: 21.1/98 = 0.21.¬† So the stock looks incredibly undervalued based on p/e ratio and past earnings growth. And that doesn‚Äôt even include the potential of the new acquisitions.

If someone wants to check me on my numbers and math, that would be great! I definitely could have made some mistakes or I could even be completely wrong here so please check me.

The Odd Couple - Waymo & Uber Join Forces,"In the world of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing, a new power couple has emerged:¬†**Waymo**¬†and¬†**Uber.**¬†Once fierce competitors vying for dominance in the autonomous driving space, they have now joined forces in a strategic partnership that has sent ripples through the industry.¬†

This article will explore this unlikely alliance, analyzing the financial and strategic motivations behind it, the potential benefits and risks for both companies, and the overall impact on the future of transportation

# From Rivals to Partners: A Shift in Strategy

The Waymo-Uber partnership, initially announced in May 2023 and expanded in September 2024, marks a significant shift in strategy for both companies.¬†

**Uber**, once heavily invested in developing its own autonomous driving technology, has since exited that endeavor and pivoted to a platform-based approach. This partnership allows them to integrate Waymo's proven technology into their ride-hailing app without the substantial R&D costs and risks.

**Waymo**, on the other hand, gains immediate access to Uber's massive user base and operational infrastructure, accelerating the deployment and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service.

# A Look at the Financials

Understanding the financial motivations behind this partnership is crucial.

**Uber**, despite showing strong financial performance in 2023 and early 2024 with 15% revenue growth, a shift to profitability, and strong cash flow generation (revenue of $37.3 billion in 2023 and $10.1 billion in Q1 2024, operating profit of $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.4 billion free cash flow in Q1 2024)^(\[2\]\[4\]), is facing increasing pressure from investors regarding its long-term prospects in the face of autonomous driving disruption^(\[1\]). This partnership allows them to mitigate this risk and position themselves for future growth.

**Waymo**, while not publicly disclosing detailed financials, has received a new $5 billion investment from parent company Alphabet in July 2024, highlighting their continued commitment to the project^(\[3\]). The partnership with Uber offers a faster path to profitability by leveraging Uber's existing infrastructure and customer base, potentially accelerating Waymo's estimated $1.4 billion annual revenue^(\[6\]). Additionally, Waymo's financials are embedded within Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which reported $285 million revenue and $813 million operating loss in Q2 2023 and $365 million revenue and $1.13 billion operating loss in Q2 2024^(\[7\]).

# A Win-Win Situation?

**For Uber:**

* Access to Waymo's advanced AV technology without the associated R&D costs.
* Potential to increase market share by offering autonomous options to their riders.
* Improved operational efficiency and reduced costs in the long term with autonomous vehicles.
* A strategic move to future-proof their business model and remain a leader in the mobility market.

**For Waymo:**

* Rapid expansion and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service through Uber's platform.
* Increased visibility and user adoption of its technology.
* Potential for accelerated revenue growth.

# However, the partnership also presents certain risks:

**For Uber:**

* Dependency risk on Waymo's technology.
* Potential for brand dilution if Waymo's technology encounters issues or negative public perception.
* Risk of cannibalization of its existing ride-hailing business with the introduction of autonomous vehicles.

**For Waymo:**

* Potential conflicts with Uber regarding strategic goals or operational approaches.
* Regulatory scrutiny due to market dominance concerns.
* Limited control over the user experience and branding within the Uber app.

# The Road Ahead

The long-term success of this partnership will hinge on several factors:

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: Navigating the complex and evolving regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles will be crucial.
2. **Public Acceptance**: Overcoming public skepticism and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles will be paramount for widespread adoption.
3. **Competitive Landscape**: The rapid development and deployment of autonomous driving technology by other players like Tesla (whose robotaxi announcement caused Uber's stock to fall 9%) will require both companies to continuously innovate and stay ahead of the curve^(\[4\])¬†.¬†

The Waymo-Uber partnership, presents a fascinating case study of how former rivals can adapt and collaborate to navigate technological disruption and shape the future of their industry.

After my first big hit I stumbled down trying to get a foundation for my strategy. Eventually I sat down and locked in, strictly sticking to my plan (for the most part) and staying much more conservative than I was over the course of last month. Mostly stuck to SPY/QQQ calls w/ far out exp. dates

I have proof that the market is NOT gambling. ,"I'm not going to sit here for long and bore you guys to death, but I have been observing a specific area of the market that I think is often overlooked for almost the past year. Upon observing, I've come to realize that dark pool orders serve as the skeletal system of the market. 

Don't believe me? Take a look at this past week on the SPY. I've actually been kicking myself because I only profited off of one side of the move on Wednesday., which was downside where I made 300% playing these orders down to the levels in the screenshot below. 

  
I've blocked out other dark pool orders because they are significantly smaller then these two. 

https://preview.redd.it/f4alxziroood1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=745f28937a51b87d509ced28abc2bebf3a80199d

  


These dark pool orders came in on Friday after the Jobs Report. I've been paying attention to dark pool orders for the past year or so, so my strategy is usually to play the orders to their level on the dark pool. Once price reaches that level, that's my Take Profit. For example, If SPY has untapped orders at 545 and the market price is 548, I'll short SPY to 545 and I exit. 

  
On Wednesday 9-11, SPY opened up at around 549 and instantly sold off to 540. Why? Because these orders from Friday had to be touched. For the QQQ, there was a massive order at 452. So what happens next? QQQ finds support at 452 and SPY finds support at 540. It's not a coincidence, or by accident. These levels are structured throughout stock and everything in between tends to be noise. 

  
I had QQQ puts where I sold QQQ at 452, but I did not have the brain to think to buy calls at the level in this particular instance because I was trying to play it safe. I usually only play to the level because they're not always buy orders. Could have 100X my money playing the other direction, but that's life.

  
Damn, I went too long. I'll stop here. I'm new to Reddit, but if you guys like this I can analyze some dark pool orders in the coming days. ",2024-09-14,0.0,0.9532,0.4766

JPM - The father of all banks,"TL;DR: Rate cuts are coming, and guess who's gonna benefit the most? The biggest, baddest bank in the game, JPM. With earnings around the corner, I'm betting big that we see a pre-earnings run-up.

1. Catalyst - Fed Rate Cuts

Rate cuts are generally good for the market but especially good for the financial sector, particularly for big banks like JPM.

2. JPM is the Father of All Banks

They've got their hands in everything: consumer banking, investment banking, asset management, and global markets. This makes them a solid play, especially with Fed cuts coming.

3. Earnings Incoming

JPM‚Äôs earnings are set for release on October 13. I‚Äôm anticipating a pre-earnings run as more traders pile into JPM expecting strong results. The earnings usually reflect the performance of the sector, and with the market expecting relief from higher interest rates, we could see JPM leading the charge.

Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year',"Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said ‚Äî in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030.

DoorDash expected earnings,"Can anyone help me understand why DASH thinks they will be profitable for the first time in their history (outside of one earnings call in peak Covid).

Last earnings call they projected good news but I can‚Äôt tell if this expected EPS of $0.21 in Robinhood is from dash themselves or other analysts and can‚Äôt find too much more info.

Current PE is around -130 with a $55 billion market cap.

I feel like this earnings call could go disastrously and if job and spending concerns become more real in coming months one of the first things many people could cut is luxuries like delivery.

SpaceX valued at 100x more than RKLB. Why??,"
RKLB CFO just had a presentation at the Morgan Stanley 12th Annual Laguna Conference. 

He brings up a good point that SpaceX is currently valued at 100x more than RKLB but in the next years with Neutron successful launch (in about 9 months) and their already established space systems and constellation capabilities, the difference will be close to indistinguishable.

My VTLE Position and Reasoning in Solidarity with Regard,"Positions, GIMPed together, $71k cost basis: https://i.imgur.com/sVi5CIM.png

I filtered petroleum stocks by removing natgas corps, corps with high natgas mix, royalty trusts, and high cost production like Canadian oil sands. These are sorted by PE and VTLE is among the best in terms of earnings to stock price.

Their oil fields are in the Permian Basin Texas, a low cost or production region. Shale oil is fracted out. 45% of their oil is below $50/barrel breakeven. 15M barrels of oil hedged through 2025 at $75/barrel. The share price trades < 40% of tangible book value, meaning a larger corp can swallow them up for double the price and still save 20% compared to buying individual oil fields themselves.

The market cap is $1B. They made $700M in 2023 and $600M in 2022. At the current price, the market is saying the management is trash and their reinvestments are trash because for every dollar of earnings they plow back into the company, you can buy it for less than 40 cents.

The company has debt but it's not an insane amount. Debt to equity is 63%. Compare to Buffett's oil darling, OXY at 64%. 

Their recent quarterly earnings are lumpy because their hedges distort their earnings and their large recent purchases are inefficient. They buy shitty operations and make them less shitty.

Cashflows are lumpy because management is aggressive and really push it to the limit but put in guardrails through aggressive hedging so they don't just crash, burn, and die.

And yes, like that other moron keeps spamming, there is a sizeable short percentage on this. 28% short the float. I don't think it's consequential, squeeze these nuts.

They have oil reserves to last something like 10 years, I don't remember. They just need to not die and oil prices to not stay super low for a decade.

There you go, my non regard explanation for why I have a sizeable position. Unlike the other guy, I'm not insane enough to dump 200% of my net worth in it.",2024-09-13,0.296,-0.76,-0.232

$RIVN ‚Äì Long-Term Potential or Just Another EV Gamble? Seeking Opinions,"I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on Rivian ($RIVN) and wanted to get some thoughts from the community. With Amazon backing them (100,000 electric delivery vans ordered) and rumors of a potential deal with Volkswagen, Rivian seems to have some POTENTIALLY strong momentum behind it. Their focus on electric trucks and SUVs gives them a unique position in the market compared to Tesla's dominance in sedans.

That said, they‚Äôve faced some notable production delays and supply chain issues. On top of that, competition in the EV space is fierce, with major players like Tesla, GM, and Ford pushing into the electric truck/SUV market. 

I'm curious to hear from anyone with more insights: Is Rivian a solid long-term play, or are we looking at bankruptcy? What are your thoughts on their ability to scale production and meet expectations, especially as we head into 2025?

RKLB - Potential Suitors?,"Watched a great Morgan Stanley presentation with the CFO of RKLB last night.  So much to like about the way their business is developing and the level-headed folks running it.  This wasn't part of this presentation, but I spent a good deal of time thinking afterwards about how things might play out for Rocket Lab in the near term.  I wonder if they don't become a target for some company who wants to have an end-to-end, ready-made constellation of communication satellites a la Starlink.   Why not purchase the company that develops, builds, and launches them for relative peanuts; before they really start generating positive revenue and the stock runs up?  

I'm thinking about you, APPLE!  What say you?  Talk amongst yourselves.  Who else might be a natural fit to buy a company like Rocket Lab?  I know APPLE is a left field idea, but heck, they almost went into the auto biz.

Heading into next week,"Last week, exactly when the news was saying to not buy or increase exposure is when I said that it's a good buying opportunity and my other post was deleted (I did sth right or wrote the R word too many times and we are more sensitive nowadays). Lets see if this one gets removed....

So going into next week with the Fed meeting I expect the market to trend sideways or slightly down (SPY around 553-563). Looking at index divergence QQQ definitely experienced sharper drops and is lagging SPY and DIA. For a bullish case into late sept-oct we need to see QQQ catching up, but we could also see a selloff of SPY and DIA, which isn't that great for bulls.

The most likely outcome for a rate cut is 25bp, there could still be a 50bp cut, but I believe the outcome that guarantees smooth sailing into the future months is a 25bp cut and the Fed more or less hinting towards another 2-3 rate cuts later into the year. The 50bp cut will just signal something is wrong with the economy. The no cut scenario might be the worse one, but giving it only a 1% chance since the dual mandate of the Fed involves keeping inflation close to the 2% target and maximum employment. They haven't been doing too great on the employment part so future cuts is the more likely outcome.

I would recommend taking profits if you did buy the lows and waiting it out until after the meeting. Hopefully this will save some of you guys from buying the top (if it pumps before the Fed meeting) or selling the bottom (if it drops too much beforehand). There was some rotation from big money into bond etfs though I'm not sure if the cuts are already priced in or not so this is rather risky unless IV is low and you can play both sides before the announcement. Large insder buys/sells wise I am pretty much seeing only Buffet dump BAC shares either to have cash or rotate into something else. I think banks won't be doing too well if rates go lower, but it should benefit tech, real estate and companies that need to do some debt restructuring. 

I think generally you'll want to take some profits and wait out Wednesday to see the direction. If it's looking bullish then buying dips and holding for longer is gonna be a good plan, if it's looking bearish it's better to buy large dips and then take profits on retracements in the same day.",2024-09-13,0.0,0.9721,0.48605
The strike at Boeing ($BA) is just the start. The next quarterly report will be a mess. Making a small bet in the $120 strike put option,"As you know, Boeing has messed up again, and the ongoing work strike could last another 1-2 months, similar to the automotive strikes. This will likely drain Boeing‚Äôs cash flow by at least another $3 billion. Given they‚Äôre already operating with negative cash flow, any further bleed will push back their timeline to achieve positive cash flow.

Keep in mind that the upcoming quarterly report is shaping up to be another nightmare for shareholders. The additional red tape in their production process, aimed at improving quality, is only going to slow things down further, leading to more delivery delays and cost increases.

We can expect their losses to widen, cash flow to worsen, and it‚Äôs very likely the stock price will drop below $100 after the next quarterly results. So, put it is.

DXCM ~60% drop from all time highs,"Have done a high level assessment of DXCM. I have a small position in DXCM, and will likely DCA if the price drops further.

Additional insights into DXCM and thoughts welcome.

**Company Overview:**

Dexcom (DXCM) is a leader in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which are used primarily by diabetes patients to monitor blood sugar levels in real-time.

**Market Opportunity:**

* **Increase in number of people with diabetes:** Globally, more than half a billion people live with diabetes, with the [IDF](https://diabetesatlas.org/#:~:text=Diabetes%20around%20the%20world%20in%202021%3A,%2D%20and%20middle%2Dincome%20countries) expecting this amount to increase by \~50% over the next 20 years. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/index.html), around 38 million Americans (roughly one in 10) are living with diabetes. One in five are unaware they are diabetic. In the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled.
* **Expansion into Type 2 Diabetes monitoring:** Historically, CGMs have been used primarily for Type 1 diabetes, but there is a potential to provide glucose monitoring to Type 2 diabetes patients, who outnumber Type 1 patients 10:1. Dexcom is starting to make inroads here with the approval of the G7 system for broader use, a key driver of future sales growth.
* **International expansion:** With regulatory approvals outside the US, Dexcom has significant international expansion potential.
* **Customer cost subsidisation:** The increasing insurance reimbursement for CGMs, particularly in the US and Europe, is further reducing the cost burden on patients, accelerating adoption.
* **Overall growth:** With the above, growing awareness of glucose monitoring, increased healthcare access, the CGM market is poised to grow, with some analysts expecting the overall market to increase at a 7% - 12% CAGR over the next 5 - 10 years.

**Fundamentals:**

* **Revenue model:** Dexcom sells consumable sensors which drive predictable and recurring revenue as customers need to replace sensors on a regular basis.
* **Revenue growth:** Dexcom's revenue has grown \~20% year-over-year, on a trailing 12 month basis, which is in line with the past 3 years. Management have reduced their full year 2024 guidance to 11% - 13% due to poor sales execution, partly driven by disruption from a sales force expansion (which I expect is a short term factor).
* **Margins:** Margins appear to be improving year on year. Management are forecasting improved EBITDA margins at \~29% (\~4% increase on prior year), which should accelerate Free Cashflow Growth.
* **Ratios:** After the recent decline in stock price, DXCM's Price to Sales, Price to Free Cashflow and Price to Earnings are close to Abbott's (competitor) ratios, despite the DXCM having higher and more consistent revenue growth, higher margins and higher cashflow growth.

**Risks:**

* **Competitive threats:** The CGM market is very competitive with companies like Abbott investing heavily in CGM technology. A technological breakthrough from competitors could impact DXCM‚Äôs sales.
* **GLP-1 medication:** Various GLP-1 medication (e.g. Mounjaro / Zepbound, Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus),  have shown effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss, which could decrease the demand for Dexcom's CGM devices. Despite this, CGM systems may still be required by many diabetes patients in order to monitor their glucose levels, especially those requiring precise monitoring, so the overall market for CGMs may remain strong.
* **Technological obsolescence:** Various tech companies are / are rumoured to be looking into non-invasive glucose monitoring through watches and rings. I can't find anything in testing with the FDA and nothing has been approved by the FDA. Standard review time by the FDA is [10 months](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs).",2024-09-13,-0.2732,0.9943,0.36055

OpenAI Released a New Model GPT-o1 That Only Allows 35 Messages Per Week Because It Thinks - It Also Hasn't Been Trained With All Data,"Ladies and Gentleman there cannot be a larger buy signal than this. The fact that this model requires so much power it has to be limited to 35 messages per week is incredible. I am driving this one point because it is a clear throughput situation. 

Also, the information cutoff is October 2023 which tells me this isn't the new massive model they are releasing. So, what does this all mean? 

It means they released a new capability which uses much more compute but isn't technically perhaps their new monster model that is trained on trillions of parameters. If this was a new model I would expect the cutoff date to be much more recent. At least 3-6 months would have made more sense. Now, there is time between training and cutoff time but I don't think they've been sitting with a model that has been trained for over a year ago. A newer, more recent model must be sitting there for use but can't. 

What this all suggest to me is that they are currently massively GPU constrained at the moment and waiting desperately for Blackwell. What you would expect is massively more throughput for GPT-o1 and you eventually have to expect a newer more massive model that is fundamentally better at the core. 

Joanne Jang from OpenAI tweeted this. 

>""There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch‚Äîbut we're working to get there!""

OpenAI also said they are adding additional tools later. 

So in effect, they released a new engineering marvel with model actionability/capabilities i.e. thinking - in preparation for adding a massively more capable model + new thinking capability later. It's going to be a 1, 2 punch that I don't think the world is ready for. 

The 35 messages per week is a throughput drop I could not have imagined. This is what Jensen was talking about that people are getting emotional. 

The amount of GPU spend from the new AGI race that is about to ensue is going to be insane.

Short Wells Fargo to finance expenses on the Bilt credit card through them.,"Wells Fargo has this credit card program with great rewards, which they're losing billions of dollars on. How it worked was Bilt was founded by some conman who convinced bank executives giving a card with $0 in sign up fees, and high reward rates would make them money. They would have made money if account holders carried a balance, but almost no one is doing that.

They're trying to get out of the deal, but still have seven more years of it, and it looks like they're trapped contractually. 

So, something like 6 million new people get Bilt cards, and use a Wells Fargo short position to finance their yearly expenses on it.

VTLE - Fundamental Analysis Discussion,"In my opinion, it‚Äôs an interesting play (and should be discussed, why do the mods ban this).

$1.33B ebitdax as of end of Q2 with only $1.60B net debt for minimal leverage.

Production is largely hedged for the next 12 months, so there‚Äôs plenty of optionality for oil curve to lift while the company keep clipping money from production.

At $1B equity value, enterprise value is now around 2x EBITDAX which is insanely low, even though the oil curve has since plummeted.

Compared to all similar $1-5B oil and gas companies, the equity and enterprise value have dropped far further, likely because a key holder has been liquidating.

Upside if oil pops back next 6 months is over 100% return back to $55 but in the meantime, even a return to the $30‚Äôs is a 30-50% return which is possible at these levels of oil price.

Henrik Zeberg: S&P500 to decline to 1800 in a few years,"Henrik Zeberg has argued that the stock market is in for a massive decline in the coming years. He expects a blow off top to happen in the coming months with the S&P500 reaching 6100 to 6300, and then to go down sharply. There will be a deep recession and the FED will do QE again in a big way, leading to a big bounce in the economy and the stock market. But then inflation will tick up again and the stock market will start to slide down. He then expects the S&P500 to bottom out at around 1800 in a few years from now. 

I think this sort of a scenario is very plausible. The stock market is enormously overvalued, it has gone up a lot relative to the economy via multiple expansion. Traders are mostly making realized profits off the losses of their fellow traders, the inflows from the real economy are very low. The value of the portfolios of investors is mostly just unrealizable phantom wealth. 

It's as if you have a big insolvent bank whose clients are happy to put their money in a savings account with that bank, because they don't believe the bank is insolvent and the bank pays every account holder 10% interest per year. The bank doesn't have that money, it just issues account statements displaying the 10% interest payment, 

The wise thing to do if you have an account at such a bank, is to pull your money out before it is too late. And given that the bank is insolvent, it's als a given that only a fraction of the account holders will ever be able to pull their money out. ",2024-09-12,0.0,0.9731,0.48655
What do you guys think about Micron before their Sept earnings?,"Their stock has dropped considerably since the highs. This despite that earnings results were not that bad.

Their (1yr) Forward P/E ratio is now absolute rock bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/s706gocmmeod1.png?width=2298&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1feafac3c75c116bd98c7198c4c71411be1bca

The bear case for them is that they are investing too much in production capacity. This is odd considering how backed up they are in terms of supplying DRAMs. 

An additional bear case is that their profit margins were low \~11%.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins)

But this seems to be cyclic (they have always been). Their traditional profit margins have averaged around 40%, which is a pretty decent number. The fact that they invested in manufacturing capacity to meet the demand, kind of explains the lower margins in the last quarter.

Given all this, why is Micron not a solid buy before the Sept 27th earnings? What am I missing?

Disclosure: I do have a small position (\~200 stocks, which is down 30%). But I wonder, why this is not a time to load up on some options?

Guess what? I just loaded some $INTC Intel Put yesterday. ,"Yeah, I‚Äôve been thinking the same thing‚Äîwho shorts Intel when it's already at rock bottom? I‚Äôve been mulling over this for the past week, and my gut says to going long since the stock has dropped over 30%. Plus, all the bad news about the upcoming quarterly results should be mostly priced in by now.

But after digging into it, I don‚Äôt think Intel‚Äôs troubles are over. They‚Äôve been losing ground in the mobile and AI markets, and the competition in the PC processor space is brutal. The CEO is doing his best to turn things around, but big changes like selling off unprofitable segments (like Altera or Mobileye) or spinning off their foundry‚Äîif the rumors are true‚Äîwon‚Äôt happen overnight. Meanwhile, they‚Äôre still burning cash in these areas.

On top of that, Intel‚Äôs dealing with chip defects and warranty costs are going to be hurt. Their Meteor Lake production is facing bottlenecks, and while they‚Äôve launched Lunar Lake, it‚Äôs too early to tell how sales will go. Plus, the export ban to China is another blow to their revenue.

$CELH - Looking Interesting at current levels,"I build a simplistic model on CELH. With reasonable assumptions of:

* Annual Revenue growth post 2024 between 15-20%
* GM expanding to 53.5%
* Operating leverage kicking in 

EPS can get to 1.8/share by 2028. At a forward multiple of 30x, the stock could trade between 50-55 by end 2027 creating a 65% upside. The downside does look limited from here

Key to watch is the Gross margin profile over next two quarters as revenue decelerates. The stock could be under pressure in short term.

On top of that last quarter EBITDA margin is -158%‚Ä¶down 37% from same quarter last year.

Now if SOUN was some sort of revolutionary category defining company‚Ä¶maybe I could get on board. But it‚Äôs just mostly a customer service/customer experience tool‚Ä¶not even particularly differentiated at that. Plenty of competition in the AI sound and voice recognition space.

Now granted it‚Äôs growing much faster than your typical public SaaS company at ~54% YoY‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs easy when revenue is only around $50M. No way that growth rate is sustainable for this business. 

The 8-12x revenue multiple range is where SOUN market cap should be right now‚Ä¶I have a feeling we‚Äôll see it there sometime not too far off in the future.

Hear me out... It's Macy's ($M) üõçÔ∏è,"I know what you're thinking‚Äî Macy‚Äôs? Really? The department store my grandma shops at? Before you scroll, hear me out guys. There‚Äôs a lot  going on with this stock that a lot of people are sleeping on, take a closer look below and let me know what you think...

# üí∞ 1. That Dividend Though... üí∞

Let‚Äôs start with the **dividend**. Macy‚Äôs has a **dividend yield over 4%** right now. It‚Äôs sitting at $0.165 per share, which is pretty solid in the grand scheme of the market. While most companies have been cutting dividends  Macy‚Äôs have been paying consistently since they brought it back post-Covid. 

The ex-dividend date is coming up on September 13 BTW. Pays out October 1st.

# üè¶ 2. Macy‚Äôs is Not Broke, Far From It üè¶

From all the public statements Macy‚Äôs has been cleaning up its balance sheet. They‚Äôve been aggressively paying down debt and have over **$1 billion in cash**. They're closing underperforming stores and cutting costs which I'm sure led to some antiquated bloat. They‚Äôve pivoted hard into e-commerce (probably forced at gunpoint to), which now makes up almost 40% of their sales. 

# üè¢ 3. REAL ESTATE üè¢

Here‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt realize‚Äî**Macy‚Äôs owns an insane amount of real estate**. The store at **Herald Square in NYC alone is** worth a fortune. Macy‚Äôs has been sitting on some prime real estate for years, and there are rumors they co**uld sell or spin off s**ome of these properties. They‚Äôve already sold some assets before, like their San Francisco Men‚Äôs store alone for $250 million.

# üî• 4. Super Undervalued Right Now üî•

Here‚Äôs the kicker: Macy‚Äôs is trading at a **P/E ratio of 4.8**. For those not familiar that is super low for a company that‚Äôs still quite profitable. 

Wall Street is underestimating them. Earlier this year, there were **buyout offers for Macy‚Äôs at $24.80 a share**, but the stock is currently sitting around **$13/14** or so. That‚Äôs a huge gap, and you'd have to think that if any buyout talks reignite or they start unlocking their real estate value, Macy‚Äôs stock surge back up quickly.

Disclaimer, I own a somewhat tiny position but curious about what the group things. ",2024-09-12,0.0,0.9337,0.46685

Can this be considered insider trading? ,"Soo, maybe this is a really dumb question but i am really curious about it. 

Consider a scenario where one possesses material non-public information about a company's impending negative event. Instead of trading the company's securities directly, they purchase shares of a competitor that could benefit from the negative event. Is this considered insider trading, lets say coca cola for example i have a privileged information that either coca cola or any brand is about to crash or have a really bad report regarding its health effects on people or, anything that could hurt them, but lets say you use that information not to sell, nor go short on the stock, but however buy stock from a competitor, lets say Pepsi, that could be really benefited with the downfall of Coca Cola.

Ethanol Companies GPRE and REX opportunities,"Ethanol companies are trading super low and disconnected from fundamentals.  Green Plains just hit a multi-year low yesterday, all the while crush margins have been extremely high and these companies should be flowing a lot of money to the bottom line.  Green Plains has 11% short interest, so not super high, but also has had a big activist investor Ancora Holdings pushing them to unlock value.  An analyst last week even upgraded the stock with a price target of $28 which is more than double the current share price.  

Ethanol companies had some profitability issues when corn spiked due to the Russia/Ukraine War causing crush margin to be very slim.  With a good US Corn crop coming in and low corn prices, ethanol crush margins have expanded to the 50 cent range per gallon this quarter, up from a few cents just earlier this year.  

  
Ethanol demand is also growing as higher blending and roll out of E15/Unleaded 88 gas takes hold and also export demand as other countries such as Canada blend higher.  Japan and Vietnam are also in the process of increasing ethanol blend rates which would mean further export demand. 

REX has had 16 straight quarters of profitability even with the challenges, and is now sitting on a pile of cash that is equal to half their market cap.  It's possible they could be targeted by an activist investor as well to unlock that cash or put it to work, as their cash pile continues to grow and will grow more rapidly with higher crush margins and profitability.  They may even have to look at acquiring other producers such as ALTO which trades at a discount to their book value and would have synergies.  

There was also a big announcement last week where an ethanol producer with 70 million gallons of capacity entered into a $205 million dollar agreement with Bank of America for tax credits from carbon capture.  GPRE has close to 1.0 Billion gallons of capacity and REX 350 million gallons, both are pursuing carbon capture and once implemented could also reap the same unlock of tax credit funding, which alone is many times each their market caps.  It seems as if there is value to be unlock and the market has been missing this at the moment with ethanol stocks.  ",2024-09-11,0.3818,0.9635,0.67265

Relax on Nvidia: Why Both Bulls and Bears are Wrong and Overinflated,"The short story for those who want a shorter read: 

Take a deep breath everyone and look at the bigger picture - not just today or even this month. Bulls on this reddit page seem to deny that the stock can go down more than 5% or 10% (it's healthy and normal) or don't look at how the market is doing overall that explains a lot of these swings. Bears on the other hand are in this perpetual nvidia is overvalued, the stock will drop below $100 to the extent that any time it drops - people freak out and we panic sell, then buy, then repeat. 

Relax and chill people - if you believe in Nvidia, chips, AI than just hold the stock and maybe look at some others in your portfolio like SoundHound or Palantir. 

I'm just trying to say we all do it but stop looking so much at what this stock is doing today, this week, or the stock has to drop because stocks usually don't do well in September - all of these matter much less to what the stock does a year, two, and five from now. Plus I get it stocks usually sell off in September, but it doesn't mean they have to have a bad month just like July or December don't have to be good (it's a pattern but patterns can and often are not always followed)

The last couple months Nvidia has swung back and forth between around $90-$100 at the lowest points to around $130 at the highest. Each time, bulls have said it would go much higher. Bears on the other hand, have said that the stock has to go down because either it's overvalued, recession fears, September is usually bad for stocks, or because of other macroeconomic or geopolitical concerns. 

There have been way too many posts or comments like ""I just bought this stock, should I sell now"" or will the price go lower or higher in the next week or so. People are nervous and there's nothing wrong with that but that's part of the reason you're seeing these massive fluctuations is because Nvidia is so well known there are tons of people that want to trade it. That, and ever shifting media coverage that is either good or bad and the fact that whatever the market does - Nvidia amplifies that move because it's a growth stock.

Long term I believe in Nvidia but short term really is anyone's guess. Unless someone traveled into the future with Marty and the Doc, you can't know what the stock will due short term. Sometimes you might be able to guess better than others but this is a great stock and company. 

Yes, it won't likely 10x from here but this is still a growing company. Plus, if you've held the stock from when it was around $100 pre split which wasn't a century ago, it will still go up big for you. That's because from here on out, every time the stock goes up $100 that's the same as going up $1000 pre split - it's just people don't think about it that way.

Earlier this year, every time the stock went up $100 pre split it was a huge deal. Now that's the same as going up $10 which shows how crazy that is. 


I like the stock split for being on new investors - that's great - but it doesn't show the full extent of how much this stock has been swinging between full on bull or bear (we've been moving about $300 pre split but people don't see it that way because the stock split altered how people see it.",2024-09-11,-0.0516,0.9557,0.45205

US closer to greenlighting Nvidia chips for Saudi Arabia,"Sept 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering allowing Nvidia to export advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, potentially helping the country train and run the most powerful AI models, Semafor reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The sales of the chips were a main but unofficial topic at GAIN, Saudi Arabia's global AI summit, on Thursday, the report said.

Attendees of the summit, including some who work for the Saudi Data and AI Authority, told Semafor that the country is making efforts to comply with U.S. security requirements to expedite the acquisition of the chips.

There are different reasons as why one succeeds or fails in the stock market but a widely underestimated one is the ability of being able to control one‚Äôs emotions. 

Son, the very principle of the stock market is to try and differentiate yourself from others. The goal here is to have somewhat of a new perspective on things in order to outperform your regarded peers. 

You know one easy way to do dat ? You buy when they sell. You sell when they buy. It is the most basic yet effective way to go against the grain in order to fuck that little grain right in his tiny ass. 

Can this be applied in every and all situations ? Of course not regard, but it‚Äôs a good basis in order to begin somewhere. 

Pattern trading is not a thing regard, day trading is not a thing either. Stop doing that. Do more of the thing that makes money : Investing.

"NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell Overcomes Delays, as GB200 Reportedly Sets for December Mass Production","https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/09/10/news-nvidias-blackwell-overcomes-delays-as-gb200-reportedly-sets-for-december-mass-production/

_According to a report from Commercial Times citing sources, it‚Äôs revealed that NVIDIA has executed changes to the Blackwell series‚Äô 6-layer GPU mask. Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized._

_The report noted that NVIDIA‚Äôs updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year._

_Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA‚Äôs GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips._

_Industry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July._

_In addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary. Still, as CoWoS-L capacity remains a bottleneck, the advanced packaging for GB200 this year is expected to adopt  CoWoS-S._

NVDL as a hedge?,"Sooo I have about $850k in NVDA currently that grew from being invested 5+ years ago. I believe in NVDA long term, but I know chips are cyclical and i dont think there's any information that could come out that could draw hype rn so I dont expect it to go up much in the short term. I think this because AI is the current hype generator and NVDA has cemented its place in the lead already so any hype would be dampened.

It could go up more short term or tank, but I cant predict the future, so currently my plan is holding all $850k in NVDA for 10 more years at least. I like the company. I believe in it long term. 

But now I have another idea:

What if I sold all $850k and put $425k from the ~$650k left after taxes in NVDL? The idea is that I would still gain or lose around the same amount of $ for the 10 years since NVDL is 2x leveraged, but now I also have ~$225k cash to by a potential dip or invest in general during the possible upcoming recession. I dont think the 1.15% expense ratio is significant enough to dissuade me because if the price never changes over 10 years, thats still only ~$47k in fees.

To me this seems like getting the best of both worlds, holding NVDL in case there is another spike short term (this is what I was referring to as a hedge but idk if that's an improper use of the term) and also having cash to be able to buy into a dip or other stocks. But I must be missing something. What do you guys think?

And keep in mind that currently my plan is to keep holding all $850k in NVDA, so this idea should be compared to that, but I'm also open to other suggestions.

Btw I am in no way saying I think this is smart. I just got lucky with NVDA and I want to make sure I capitalize on it. This is just an idea and I'm trying to gather perspectives and learn from others too. Thanks in advance!


Edit - 9/13: I sold all of my NVDA that was in ROTH today (2000 shares). Im going to hold the taxable shares long term.

And with significant lower oil price, high LNG inventories in Japan and a YEN becoming more expensive compared to the USD, I expect that BoJ will not have to raise their rate in coming months, making it a less aggressive rate hike.

Next BoJ rate hike in January 2025 maybe.

ASTS Tanked due to Misunderstood ATM Offering,"**TLDR:** No offering this year per CEO, massive catalyst on Thursday. (launch of Block-1)

ASTS experienced a sharp 10% decline last week, with a massive midweek drop of 20% from the highs, due to a misunderstanding by the market of the future ATM offering(Next year). Here's a breakdown of what happened and why it might be an overreaction:

1. **ATM Strategy Misunderstood**: The market reacted negatively to the news that ASTS has set up a $400 million At-The-Market (ATM) offering. It's crucial to understand that the offering is set for next year, so the stock is safe from dilution until next year. No shares have been sold under this new arrangement yet. Historically, ASTS has utilized its ATMs very effectively, raising capital at favorable prices, which has substantially reduced the projected future shares outstanding, enhancing per-share value over time.
2. **Bank Partnerships and Upcoming Coverage**: The addition of Bank of America, Cantor, and Roth to this ATM is strategic. These institutions are likely to initiate research coverage, potentially around the time of the Block-1 satellite launch, which could boost investor confidence and stock valuation.
3. **Firm Stance Against Public Offerings**: Despite the setup of the ATM, they have clearly said in the last 2 quarter calls that there's no interest in public market offerings through at least the end of 2024.
4. **An important catalyst on Thursday**: The Block-1 launch is scheduled for this Thursday and is considered a major catalyst. Common shareholders have been invited to the launch. Honestly, I respect that move as I hadn't seen any other company before inviting their common share holders to a launch.
5. **Potential for Definitive Agreements**: With technology and funding risks mitigated, ASTS is in a position to negotiate more definitive commercial agreements that could include pre-paid revenues and investments, leading to it not needing to dilute shares, or if it needed, to do it with significantly much less shares.
6. **Deutsche Bank Upgrades ASTS Price Target to $63**: Deutsche Bank has significantly raised its price target from $22 to $63, maintaining a strong buy rating. This adjustment is based on key factors they mentioned including the advancements in AST's core technology, imminent commercial satellite launches, strengthening partnerships with major telecom operators like AT&T and Verizon, successful fundraising efforts, and crucial regulatory approvals. The bank's model now uses a more conservative valuation framework that accounts for the high risks associated with a pre-revenue company, setting a future enterprise value based on expected EBITDA in 2030 and adjusting for risks with a 25% cost of equity.

In conclusion, while the headline about the ATM might have spooked the market, it has definitely been misunderstood, and lead to ignoring(forgetting) the massive catalyst(launch)

Would like to hear your thoughts on the situation.

PANW is overvalued,"A blackhat conference video about Cortex XDR was published on YouTube a few days ago.

Most of you will not understand the details of this video but I will summarize it for you. A security researcher was able to completely shit on Cortex XDR (PANW main product to protect computers) and not only disabling it completely, but also abuse it in order to gain the same level of capabilities the XDR has. The guy was able to do the following:

1. Easily understand the detection techniques the XDR uses to prevent certain attacks and bypass them with publicly known techniques
2. Modify the crucial configuration files of the XDR with publicly available and known techniques
3. Cut off the XDR from the updates of the configuration files
4. Disable the protections that prevent you from dumping memory of system critical processes
5. Completely turn off the XDR by tampering with the crucial configuration files
6. Abuse all of the previous issues found to implant his own malware into the XDR and basically let it run with the same level of privilege of the XDR (max privilege), the malware would basically be completely hidden and ""protected"" by the XDR because it runs inside the same process so you can't even terminate it

Why this is interesting? This demonstrates how obsolete and old their XDR is and how low is the protection it offers for it's extremely high price tag. The techniques they use to protect the system are the same used by the cheapest antivirusses you can think of, mostly based of blacklists and whitelists which first of all need to be constantly updated and maintained safe on the local system, but in some cases a list of names is easily bypassable just by changing the file names involved (like the researcher did).

Whats the trade you're gonna ask me now. I don't believe they will go bankrupt or massively drop anytime soon because they have the advantage of a high cost vendor lock-in, which means switching to a different vendor is very expensive. Will they cause a global outage like CRWD did? Possible but impossible to predict when and if it will ever happen.  
  
What I believe is that they will not be able to keep up with the constant evolution of malware. Considering how big and very well known their customers are, if just one of these big bois is compromised, the reputational damage is going to be extremely high. Their XDR is technically considered a ""legacy"" solution, just like CRWD so I won't be surprised to see Falcon XDR getting pwned like Cortex XDR.

So what? The next gen solutions are already here but they are not getting enough attention yet. One of these next gen solutions is Sentinel One (S), their XDR uses a real AI model (not like PANW and CRWD, they don't do shit with AI, it's only marketing what they do) which doesn't rely on purely black/white lists and doesn't need constant updates in order to be useful. This key difference between legacy and next gen is crucial to understand, the absolute complete reliance on updated lists will never allow legacy products to detect an unknown threat. Sentinel One solution was able to detect and stop completely new and never seen before malwares multiple times, something Cortex or Falcon are simply not designed for and unable to do right now.

TLDR

PANW is ass and most likely CRWD is at the same level if not even worse. The big corps are regarded enough to not care about something as important as security until shit happens and then they can simply blame their security vendor. Their competitor S is not recognized enough yet because switching is expensive, their product is relatively young compared to CRWD or PANW and it takes years to gain credibility and the respect of the industry. Sentinel one product is simply superior and they have been the first to develop this kind of solution which is slowly reaching maturity. 

My position is only shares and no options because it's hard to tell how and when the industry will recognize them as the new leaders:

I have reduced my position this summer because the Vision Pro didn‚Äôt live up to the hype (I don‚Äôt own it, used it for trial).

I have been pondering selling my position further until they promised Apple Intelligence. Which I didn‚Äôt care about much for all the dumb gimmicks of emojis and text generation, image retouch etc. But for smart Siri I got excited.

Unfortunately *A*pple *I*ntelligence revealed a gaping issue to me that I wasn‚Äôt aware of with Apple before. Sure they were never first movers, but at least they made up by delivering later but then superior and polished products regularly. 

They said the chip for the iPhone 16 will be designed for AI, that‚Äôs why older models than the 15 won‚Äôt be able to run it. Chip architecture must have started to be developed almost a year ago. Yet all of apples AI features aren‚Äôt even remotely ready at launch. How can you optimize a chip for functions you haven‚Äôt even developed yet? It seems to me they missed the boat big time and are lying out of their pockets, it all seems super rushed like a school project 10 minutes before the deadline. 

Half the other buzzwords during the event like hearing aid and noise protection all seemed directed at an older crowd. Like I thought about getting AirPods for my mom hearing about the features. But not for me‚Ä¶

I know apple isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I don‚Äôt own a mac as an engineer but I‚Äôm still locked into the system with just my TV, iPad, AirPods and iPhone.

What Investors Don't Understand About Nvidia's Recurring Revenue Model Via DGX Cloud - Oracle's Bombshell ER - Acres of Nvidia GPUs and AWS,"**Oracles September 9th Q1 2025 ER:**

>""**Oracle has 162 cloud¬†datacenters in operation and under construction around the world,"" said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. ""The largest of these datacenters is 800 megawatts and will contain acres of NVIDIA GPU Clusters for training large scale AI models. In Q1, 42 additional cloud GPU contracts were signed for a total of $3 billion.** Our database business growth rate is increasing as a result of our MultiCloud agreements with Microsoft and Google. At the end of Q1, 7 Oracle Cloud regions were live at Microsoft with 24 more being built, and 4 Oracle Cloud regions were live at Google with 14 more being built. Our recently signed AWS contract was a milestone in the MultiCloud Era.¬† Soon customers will be able use the latest Oracle database technology from within every Hyperscaler's cloud.""  
...  
""As Cloud Services became Oracle's largest business, both our operating income and earnings per share growth accelerated,"" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. ""Non-GAAP operating income was up 14% in constant currency to $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was up 18% in constant currency to $1.39 in Q1. RPO was up 53% from last year to a record $99 billion. That strong contract backlog will increase revenue growth throughout FY25. **But the biggest news of all was signing a MultiCloud agreement with AWS‚Äîincluding our latest technology Exadata hardware and Version 23ai of our database software‚Äîembedded into AWS cloud datacenters. AWS customers will get easy and convenient access to the Oracle database when we go live in December later this year.**""

Acres and Acres of Nvidia GPU's. Can you imagine a field of Nvidia multi-million dollar GPU racks powering the next wave of super advanced AI? That's what Oracle just reported in a bombshell earnings report. I can't remember many earnings report where they literally flex another company's technology as the reason why they are accelerating and generating record breaking revenue but here we are.

But here is the thing that people don't get about Nvidia's revenue model for data centers and I think it needs repeating. It was something that Jensen mentioned on Nvidia's past earnings call. An analyst asked him why doesn't Nvidia make distribute their own chips directly. Jensen said no, ""we work directly through are OEM/ORM's to fulfill our distribution and that's how it will always be"".

But another analyst question was even more peculiar because I showed the analyst doesn't realize how Nvidia's data center business model works and I think it needs repeating. When major cloud providers, including Oracle, purchase Nvidia GPU hardware they have 2 hierarchy options of what they will do with Nvidia GPU's.

1. They use the hardware for their own compute needs and produce an output through an offering such as an LLM, gaming, or other accelerated compute needs directly. And end product if you will.
2. They provide GPU's as actual hardware to lease out to enterprises and businesses such as startups that want to do their own accelerated compute. The offering here is called DGX Cloud.

The second delivery method here is in fact recurring revenue in many cases. A startup doesn't have to worry about going out and buying a datacenter and install on prem Nvidia hardware when they can just lease a node directly all major cloud providers. Now here's the thing, when using Nvidia hardware you will purchase the underlying DGX platform capabilities including CUDA.

**HPCWire March 2023**

>Renting the GPU company‚Äôs DGX Cloud, which is an all-inclusive AI supercomputer in the cloud, starts at $36,999 per instance for a month.  
...

>The DGX Cloud starting price is close to double that of $20,000 charged by Microsoft Azure for a fully-loaded A100 instance with 96 CPU cores, 900GB of storage and eight A100 GPUs per month.

**From the same article, circa 2023, look at how this exact sentiment hit home via today's Oracle earnings report!**

>Oracle is hosting DGX Cloud infrastructure in its RDMA Supercluster, which scales to 32,000 GPUs. Microsoft will launch DGX Cloud next quarter, with Google Cloud‚Äôs implementation coming after that.

>Customers will have to pay a premium for the latest hardware, but the integration of software libraries and tools may appeal to enterprises and data scientists.

>But Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary hardware and software is like using the Apple iPhone ‚Äì you are getting the best hardware, but once you are locked in, it will be hard to get out, and it will cost a lot of money in its lifetime.

Mind you, this to date has been all done via the H100 platform. We haven't even started into the Blackwell GB200 Superchip offering. Blackwell will literally amplify this model probably 10X. Nvidia will offer the complete system of the **DGX B200 SuperPODs** and a much more powerful Superchip offering of **DGX GB200 SuperPODs** which has a configuration from $3 million or more depending on the setup and the number of GPU's included.

So while the Superchips cost could be $70,000 themselves a fully-equipped server rack that is leased will cost astronomically higher per month than $36,999 per instance for a month. The pricing for this hasn't been released but I assure you it could be in the $500k to $1 million+ per month range \[speculation here\]. Remember, the leasing will be for DGX Cloud and CUDA software licensing.

Remember, Jensen has said they will be more inclined to sell the full server systems.

>Another thing to consider about Nvidia's B200 is that the company may not really be inclined to sell B200 modules or cards. It may be much more inclined to sell DGX B200 \[GB200\] servers with eight Blackwell GPUs or even DGX B200 SuperPODs with 576 B200 \[GB200\] GPUs inside for millions of dollars each.¬†

To learn more about Nvidia DGX SuperPOD with DGX GB200 Systems here [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod-gb200/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod-gb200/)

If you're not familiar with what GB200 Superchips are here are some key highlights.

1. **GB200**: Combines both GPU and CPU into a single superchip (referred to as the **Grace Hopper** superchip), featuring **72-core ARM-based CPUs** along with Blackwell GPUs.
2. **GB200**: Features higher memory bandwidth and capacity, with **up to 624GB of total memory**, leveraging HBM3e technology and LPDDR5X memory.
3. **GB200**: Provides higher aggregate performance due to its CPU-GPU integration, making it suitable for both AI and HPC workloads in more unified environments.
4. **GB200**: Typically offered as part of high-performance systems like the **SuperPOD**, providing a seamless combination of both CPU and GPU resources to meet large-scale AI and data science needs.

Why is the ""G"" along with the ""B"" so important. Imagine, all of the revenue that Nvidia has done TO DATE is solely with the H100; not even the H200/GH200 AI factory systems. lol, think about that. ALL OF THESE BILLIONS and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS have only been via the H100 chip. The H200/GH200 just recently came out so while customers are needing to purchase the H200's the real platform GH200 SuperPOD server systems probably have not even begun to take hold with a lot of anticipation for the more powerful GB200 systems.

So you see, when Jensen told that analyst that NO they won't deliver direct as a cloud vender is because they don't have to and they already are delivering as a cloud provider via stronger contractual agreements while allowing others to also profit and eat from the hardware purchase which is exactly what Oracle reported today.

Others buy the hardware and Nvidia reaps the benefit of that plus the platform instance leasing for the entire stack including software which will always be recurring revenue.

In this way, Nvidia won't have a hard landing and in fact will be one of the largest companies the world has ever seen and it already is. However, people just don't realize that Nvidia is a cloud company in it's own way. It's just doing it in a way where everyone eats at his table. It's really amazing when you think about it.

There you have it folks, acres and acres of recurring revenue through DGX Cloud and CUDA software licensing. Nvidia already IS a Cloud Provider and a very good one at that.",2024-09-10,0.0,0.9983,0.49915

The best play of the year after NVDA : OXY petroleum ,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is currently trading near its 52 week low.  OXY is driven in large part by the broader softness in oil prices. Historically, the stock price of OXY has been highly correlated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and it appears the company is undervalued in relation to both its assets and potential future earnings.

Over the past two years, every time the price of oil has approached $65 per barrel on the WTI Crude oil , it has marked a significant bottom for both crude oil prices and OXY's stock price. Given the cyclical nature of the oil market and the company's strong fundamentals, OXY's current valuation represents an attractive entry point, with considerable upside potential as the oil market stabilizes and eventually recovers.


Historically, OXY has seen strong price recoveries whenever oil prices have tested this level multiple times, and each time, prices rebounded as demand fundamentals improved or geopolitical factors led to tightening supply.

Currently, oil prices are once again nearing this critical $65 level, which suggests that the downside risk for OXY may be limited. With global demand for oil still robust, and supply potentially constrained by geopolitical tensions or production cuts from OPEC, there is a reasonable expectation that oil prices will stabilize or rise in the medium term. This would provide a tailwind for Occidental's stock price, as the company benefits directly from higher oil prices through increased revenues and profitability.

**OXY is Undervalued**

In terms of valuation, OXY is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that is below its historical average and lower than many of its peers in the energy sector. This undervaluation is evident when comparing the company‚Äôs market capitalization to its assets and earnings potential. Occidental‚Äôs massive oil and gas reserves, along with its investments in sustainable energy technologies, make it one of the better-positioned companies to weather fluctuations in the energy market.

Moreover, Occidental has significantly improved its financial position in recent years. The company‚Äôs aggressive debt reduction program has strengthened its balance sheet, making it less vulnerable to swings in oil prices. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway remains a major shareholder in OXY, having increased its stake in the company over the past two years. This signals strong institutional confidence in Occidental's long-term prospects, adding credibility to the view that the stock is currently

Occidental is not just about oil production; it is about hedging against tech stock that are overvalued right now

To summarize :

Occidental Petroleum is trading near its 52-week low, largely driven by oil price weakness. With oil approaching the $65 per barrel mark, historically a bottom for both crude prices and OXY stock, the current situation presents an opportunity for long-term investors. Given its undervaluation relative to earnings potential, strong balance sheet, and strategic positioning in both traditional oil production and sustainable energy technologies, OXY represents a strong buy at its current levels. The company‚Äôs operational resilience, coupled with the likelihood of oil price recovery, provides significant upside potential for investors looking for value in the energy sector.

Let me know if I'm crazy or not... Did the internet help push Big Money into Private Equity?,"Wealth is on the retreat to private markets. Spurred by the greater informational efficiency provided by the internet, institutional limited partners are finding it increasingly difficult to achieve returns in public markets. Time and experimentation will tell of the statistical significance, but at this moment I‚Äôm just informing you of what I see. I attribute this thought to sitting through FNCE 205: Investment Management.

For decades, Wall Street has profited off of ‚Äúdumb money.‚Äù Centered around the premise that normal everyday investors operate [irrationally](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185) in their actions and positions in the public markets. This suboptimality is attributed to human nature but at its root is an [information divide](https://www.investopedia.com/the-digital-divide-5116352). Investors have been watching the pool of dumb money slowly drain. However, how do you prove that retail investors are [getting smarter](https://www.cato.org/commentary/retail-investors-are-revolutionizing-stock-market-so-stop-calling-them-dumb-money), more powerful? But first we need to understand active vs. passive investors. [Active investors](https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/) make the buy, sell, and hold decisions. Fundamental strategy throughout this group was searching for mispriced assets. The widely known fact remains they can‚Äôt squeeze out returns like they used to. [Passive investors](https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/) on the other hand purchase a benchmark or index and hold. They are increasingly becoming attractive and growing in the face of [active‚Äôs woes](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/in-one-of-the-most-volatile-markets-in-decades-active-fund-managers-underperformed-again.html).

Prior to the inception of the internet, large active managers relied on information by acquisition, hiring large teams in charge of interviews, discovery, and reports. Information came at a premium largely unreachable by the retail investor. Post-internet information is democratized, fast, and plentiful. The advantage is decreasing, creating a world closer to the [informational efficiency](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/information-efficiency-in-financial-and-betting-markets/information-efficiency-in-financial-markets/DA442DC363CED55C0D31EA369320B6DD) established by financial theorists and their CAPM ideals. When the playing field is level, arbitrage disappears and finding returns in excess of the market becomes increasingly difficult. Today your best bet is to [index against the stock market](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/why-active-managers-have-trouble-keeping-up-with-the-pack) and hold, a sentiment that many investors agree with.

The number of publicly traded companies in the US is decreasing. The fact remains that a listing on the stock exchange isn‚Äôt as appealing as it was decades ago. The increased exposure to watchful eyes, filing requirements, fluctuating share price, and obligations to shareholders make it difficult to justify. Pair that with the growing alternatives to capital raises in early stages as well as maturation, and public status no longer makes sense.¬†

Active Management in public markets has peaked. Even hedge funds who still experience an influx of invested capital, deploy [sophisticated strategies](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/high-frequency-trading/) with astronomical costs just to yield ok returns. The single promise of market neutrality is enticing, but time will tell its continuity. Unfortunately [hedge funds](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/financial-analysts-journal/2021/hedge-fund-performance) are out of the scope of this article.

While active public strategies stagnate, capital naturally flows to the vehicles that achieve the best results. Enter private equity, the savior of the institution‚Äôs competitive advantage. When you look at its return compared to the stock market (attributed to the [Russell 3000](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/FactSheets/temp/5ddc84e9-fc4c-4008-8657-e2e24c8b14a8.pdf)) you start to understand why. The natural progression is to move through the private lanes, instead of taking the public highways.¬†

A particularly interesting point on this chart is the year 2000, when PE index value began to rise above the Russell 3000. Notice this is around the same time the internet achieved over 50% adoption. Could the internet have been the prime reason for institutional investors to begin to move out of public markets and pursue private ones which contributed to more analysis, research, and better ability to realize returns? I‚Äôm not suggesting causation, but there is apparent negative correlation. As soon as they began to be evenly matched, they‚Äôre packing up and moving elsewhere.¬†

Private Equity and markets are great for institutions, companies, and high net-worth individuals that make up limited partners but bad for the general public. It rebuilds walls representing inequality of opportunity that the internet helped destroy. Entrance is restricted to limited partners with considerable wealth or expertise. Finance thrives on building walls to enclose money making schemes away from the masses. Wouldn‚Äôt be finance without some kind of exclusive club where the smart money can reap rewards that dumb money will never have access to.¬†

If it is up to them they‚Äôll just stay and enjoy uninterrupted access. Finance is saved for experts that transform simple concepts into overly complicated jargon and models built on nonexistent soundness. They know they‚Äôve built themselves a house of cards, and the only way to keep it from falling is to keep others out and find new ways to continue to avoid the rest of us.¬†

Private markets will continue to grow as limited partners replace and find the best ways to grow their wealth. That is just simple logic and completely natural, honestly I don‚Äôt blame them. However the inherent problem lies not in the capabilities, but the inaccessibility. Maybe that‚Äôs one of the reasons they like it. They‚Äôre running a closed race amongst themselves, with a bouncer at the door checking names. Maybe they're afraid someone might be faster. Maybe they‚Äôre afraid of the threat of perfect competition resulting in zero profit. I don‚Äôt know.",2024-09-09,0.0772,0.9987,0.53795

The Future of Mental Health Treatment (Compass Pathways Due Diligence),"Novel mental health treatments are long overdue.  Psychedelic based treatments, particularly psilocybin, show a lot of promise for conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Since 2020, I have closely followed various companies that are developing psychedelic treatments for mental health disorders. Among them are Mind Medicine, Cybin, and Compass Pathways. There are many others, and the truth is practically none hold a candle to Compass Pathways. Many are frankly sketchy, underfunded, screw over retail investors via share dilution without a second thought, and will probably never commercialize any of the treatments they are working on. I mean they are largely penny stocks so this isn‚Äôt really surprising. However, I believe Compass will be the first to bring a psychedelic based treatment to market.
 
 
Compass Pathways is a UK based biotech company that includes financial backers such as Palantir‚Äôs Peter Thiel. They are primarily focused on developing a new therapeutic for treatment-resistant depression. COMP360, the drug they are working on, is a proprietary, synthetic form of psilocybin (the active compound found in psychedelic mushrooms). Phase 2b data published in the New England Journal of Medicine [showed that a single 25mg dose of COMP360 psilocybin, in combination with psychological support, was associated with a highly statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms after three weeks (p<0.001), with a rapid and durable response for up to 12 weeks](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443). COMP 360 for treatment resistant depression is now in Phase III clinical trials, [with top-line pivotal trial data expected in late Q4, though there is a possibility this could be slightly delayed until January 2025]( https://ir.compasspathways.com/news-releases/news-release-details/compass-pathways-announces-second-quarter-2024-financial-results). Additionally, they have separate clinical trials ongoing for PTSD and anorexia. Something that sets Compass apart from competitors, and why I like them so much, is their focus on high-quality clinical research. This is in stark contrast to other companies such as Lykos which recently had their MDMA based drug for PTSD rejected by the FDA due to flaws with their clinical trial design (among many other issues). This is only my opinion, but Compass never really was a meme stock like Mind Med either. They tend to avoid ‚Äúhype culture‚Äù that competitors like Mind Med have happily fuelled, often to the detriment of retail investors.  In other words, they are a serious, data focused company.
 
 Aside from promising trial data, Compass has a very solid financial position [with well over 200 million USD in cash on hand]( https://ir.compasspathways.com/static-files/fed74852-893b-468c-b958-40868a64d6e5). Given their cash burn rate, this will ensure that they will be able to conclude clinical trials, maintain their operations, and not have to worry about raising capital for a couple years.
 
 **Why I‚Äôm especially bullish on the near term**: Biotech companies that report positive Phase III clinical trial results can see major upward movement in their stock prices. For those who are new or unfamiliar, this happens because Phase III trials are the final hurdle before regulatory approval (e.g., FDA approval), and successful results significantly increase the likelihood of a new drug reaching the market. To give just a couple examples, [in December 2019, Axsome Therapeutics reported successful Phase III results for its drug AXS-05 for the treatment of major depressive disorder which caused the stock to surge 84% within a single trading session]( https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/mui8r1dzwrriumlfsw8erg2). Similarly, shares of Sage Therapeutics [soared 70 percent after the company announced positive results in the testing of a major depression treatment]( https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/sage-therapeutics-surges-60-percent-after-depression-drug-breakthrough.html). 
 
 The Federal Reserve lowering interest rates will also likely help the broader biotech sector. This is because [biotech stocks tend to outperform the market when rates are high and falling: their far-out cash flows make them more sensitive to changing rates, they majorly benefit from cheaper financing costs, and they‚Äôre more likely to be acquisition targets when rates are calmer](https://finimize.com/content/morgan-stanley-says-this-industry-should-win-when-rates-fall).

I believe that some combination of interest rate cuts and positive Phase III results will be enough to significantly increase the price of Compass. Like many other biotech companies, Compass is down substantially from its all-time high (about 87%). Positive Phase III data is a pivotal moment that could result in a major rebound and the consensus among analysts is bullish. For instance, [RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on Compass Pathways with an ‚ÄúOutperform‚Äù rating citing the potential for $2.3 billion in peak revenues from its lead psilocybin-based therapy program and setting a near term price target of $23](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/rbc-capital-launches-coverage-on-compass-pathways-cites-2-3b-revenue-potential/). Canaccord Genuity [maintains a buy rating on Compass Pathways with a price target of $48](https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/canaccord-genuity-maintains-buy-on-compass-pathways-lowers-price-target-to-48-2024-08-02). Morgan Stanley also rates Compass a buy with a $23 price target, with their analyst stating that [‚Äúbased on the data generated & stage of development for COMP360, Compass appears significantly undervalued and we find the risk/reward skewed positive into data catalysts in 2024/2025 that we believe could drive significant appreciation in shares.‚Äù]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-predicts-220-jump-130637934.html) 
 
 
 
My position: Opportunities like this are rare. 31c 7.50Call Feb2025 as well as some shares. Will build as much as I can before phase 3 readout. Will likely hold some shares indefinitely as I truly believe they will be the first to commercialize a psilocybin-based treatment for depression and if they are successful, they could very well be acquired by a major pharmaceutical company like Johnson & Johnson.  However, I also want to capitalize on near term catalysts such as successful phase III clinical trial data, hence call options. This is my first DD on here so even though it‚Äôs probably far from perfect, I hope some of you found this insightful, and will consider adding Compass to your portfolio.",2024-09-09,0.0,0.9992,0.4996

Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued ,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. 

  
This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. 

  
First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: 

\* Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. 

\* Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV.

\* The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. 

\* Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. 

\* Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. 

\* Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. 

\* Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. 

\* TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. 

\* Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. 

\* Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. 

\* Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. 

\*Intel lost Apple.

\*Intel has no phone chips. 

  
All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. 

  
While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. 

  
There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. 

  
Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows:

\* Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4

\* Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. 

\* Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. 

\* Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. 

\* Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. 

  
It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. 

Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs).  

The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. 

  
It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom. ",2024-09-09,0.7269,0.9919,0.8593999999999999

"""All In"" in Bumble - $209.000","Hello friends and regards - special shout-out to regarded friends

I just went ""all in"" with a solid 5+ through Bumble using Superswipe: ""If you were a Transformer, you'd be Optimus Fine"", I said. The total cost for this epic win? Just an estimated $5 ‚Äî considerably¬†less than the $50 I usually spent behind Wendy‚Äôs for similar quality. With this robust efficiency improvement, I immediately remembered Peter Thiel's 10x rule about what great technology can do for you. Indeed, this really got me thinking and researching about Bumble's value, leading to my first-ever Yolo bet of >$200k

**The Yolo Set-Up**: Bumble dropped a brutal 40% after Q2 reporting, and shares are now down >90% from all time highs. Shareholders are clearly swiping left on woke¬†management that has zero clue on how to monetize the most easily monetizable user group in the universe ‚Äî sexless regards sending likes and ‚ÄúHey‚Äùs in direct correlation to how much they are hoping and praying

**Deep Value Profits:**¬†But underneath the sell-off there is now a deep value thesis, imo: Bumble is generating annualized net profits of around $120-150 million, while shares are trading <$900 million. And although profits are not growing, they aren't compressing either: Indeed, Bumble's revenues are flat YoY, as Bumble continues to be one of the top-grossing apps in the U.S. and globally - check top-grossing Charts¬†[here](https://app.sensortower.com/top-charts?category=0&country=US&date=2024-09-08&device=iphone&os=ios)

**\~25% Buyback Yield:**¬†Bumble is making a solid Buffett move with its profits, using cash to buy back stock while shares are trading at basement prices:¬†

*We ended the quarter with $287 million in cash and cash equivalent. Since, the inception of our repurchase program, we have returned $241 million to shareholders representing more than 125% of our free cash flow over that time‚Ä¶*¬†*At the end of Q2, we had $209 million remaining on our $450 million total buyback authorization.*¬†*Our strong balance sheet and profitability gives us the financial flexibility to continue returning cash to our shareholders.*¬†*We remain very committed to our buyback program and continue to believe that buying back shares remains a very good use of our capital* [*(*](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/bumble-bmbl-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/)[*Post Q2 earnings call*](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/bumble-bmbl-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/)*)*

So, Bumble is gearing up to buy back \~25% of its float over the next 6-12 months.

**Fair Value Potentially At $14:**¬†I use a DCF model to value BMBL shares, based on consensus FCF estimates, a WACC of 10% and a TGV of zero. This calculation suggests that BMBL shares are fairly valued at around $14, equal to 15x FY 2025 earnings ‚Äî vs. <$7 currently.¬†I surely made a mistake in my calculation to value BMBL, because I am regarded and the alpha-male hormone release from my Bumble sex adventure is clouding my thinking. So, do your own valuation and don't trust mine blindly.

**My position:** 22,000 shares worth¬†\~$148,000; plus 20,000 call contracts with January 2025 expiration, strike $4, worth¬†\~$61,000.

Cotton futures - 1-2 years ,"I've been looking at the cotton Market recently and wanted to get peoples thoughts to see what I'm missing (assuming a lot). 

Cotton prices are around $67 the lowest I can see they have gone over the last 20 years is about $40. 

The combination of China, India and Brazil make up about 60% or more of total production (US is also a producer around 10%).

All countries are expected to have a lower than usual production this year with American being at a 14 year low. 

If you look at price spikes you can see there have been spikes in 2011 and 2018 (there have been spikes in other years as well like covid). My understanding of these spikes was driven by a la nina event (increased rain fall in certain counties). Which is expected this year.

Whilst Cotton prices typically favour higher rainfall they do not like flooding (which is occurring in at least one of the main area in India and I'm assuming some (not verified) in China). 

You may say well that makes no difference to the price given it is outside the growing (April - June ) and harvesting (August to September) months but it did in 2011 and 2018. 

What am I missing? Could the lowish price of cotton be a good buy or should I wait for more data and if so what data? 

Also thinking option futures as the premium about $3k vs an expecting of a significant gain with leverage but capping downside risk). ",2024-09-09,0.0,0.5032,0.2516

Calling the top on $TSLA. Change my mind,"1. Sales. Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There‚Äôs no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn‚Äôt on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could‚Äôve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he‚Äôs alienated them more than ever. 

He‚Äôs also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won‚Äôt serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world‚Äôs largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov‚Äôs current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He‚Äôs been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it‚Äôs not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He‚Äôll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he‚Äôs not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won‚Äôt sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.

AI is dead,"TL;DR: AI training is leading to dumber AI, which means AI progress is far behind what idiot finance AI bros expected with their valuations. However, smart people will continue investing into AI development because the bubble supercharged understanding of AI and infrastructure for AI development


I‚Äôm a physician. 2 years ago, I looked at chat gpt and was pretty sure that mfer was going to take my job. This thing was outperforming everyone in conceptualizing cases and cutting through to weeds to make intricate diagnoses. 

I was obsessed with AI over the past 2 years and I used it for a whole host of uses, even going as far as starting an AI company to help doctors with AI tools. 

Outside of my direct work, I was using AI to write various publications I needed, most regularly, recommendation letters. I fed chat gpt my writing samples and tinkered with it to create highly personalized, extremely nuanced samples. At the time, I could have it write a completely made up narrative for a rec letter that tied in values brought up in a students personal statement and used coded language typical of rec letters while delivering it in my unique voice. It was incredible and it saved me so much time.

Fast forward to today. The AI tools I developed for physicians no longer work because the AI is no longer capable of thinking in subtle or nuanced ways. All the outputs are generic bullshit with no thought. The writing has gone in the same exact direction, and now I can barely use it to put together an outline for a rec letter. 

Look across the AI world and you‚Äôll see the problem: AI has become too generic. There‚Äôs a distinct writing style that it refuses to stray from. There‚Äôs a distinct art style that it refuses to change. 2 years ago, I could ask for an impressionist painting, and I‚Äôd be impressed. Now it‚Äôs just the same 3d render crap all over the internet. 

I‚Äôm not an expert in the fundamentals of AI, but from my understanding, the speed of AI training has skyrocketed and AI benchmarks are better than ever. I have no idea what that shit means, but as a formerly heavy user of AI tools, I‚Äôm not seeing that in the end product. What I‚Äôm seeing is basically schizophrenia; profound intellectual limitations brought on by an overwhelming amount of information that can‚Äôt be cleaned up. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt other AI systems that are smart, but the AI boom was essentially set off by chat gpt and chat gpt wrapper companies. Many Companies not directly running on chat gpt were using insights developed by Open AI to guide their AI development. That means most AI are likely having the same issue of polluted training that‚Äôs getting harder and harder to clean up.  

All that being said, AI developers are in a great place. They learned a lot of great lessons and they had a chance to build out massive infrastructure and data centers. They will likely have to move several steps back in their AI development before they can move forward again, but it‚Äôll be far easier and faster than the first time around

Of course, Wall Street doesn‚Äôt give a shit about lessons learned, they care about money earned. The expectation was basically that most humans would be jobless vagrants by the end of next year, and they would be on their mega yachts earning of companies pretty much completely automated off AI. Every layoff was seen as a step towards that goal, and they could barely keep their dystopian dreams in their pants, throwing out giant green boners at every layoff announcement. 

Now AI is sputtering and companies are about to make an about face, completely destroying the narrative.

You see, the jobs reports paint an extremely clear picture for us- hiring is at a low, but firings and unemployment are steady. Basically everyone has a hiring freeze until interest rates go down and they can invest in expansions or refinance loans. This is a different story than ‚Äúhiring are down, firings are up, all jobs to the AI‚Äù

So where does this leave us? Pretty much in a similar place to the dot com bubble. The idiots are about to think AI is a useless gimmick just like they thought the internet would be a useless gimmick when pets.com sold for a billion times more than it would ever be worth. When the bubble bursts, the smart people will continue working and the economy will be rebuilt with human/AI collaboration at the core of most workflows within a decade. 

In the mid term, All stocks will likely retreat over the next month or two, with a possible crash among AI heavy tech stocks. Once the economy is confirmed to not have crashed, the market will likely have a quick recovery into a steady bull market though the end of November into January. 

Over the following year, governmental policy will determine how well the economy expands and what sectors benefit the most. In 3-4 years, we‚Äôll have a rotation back into AI fields as the tech matured and gains actual, functional adoption.

"As public school quality deteriorates, LRN enrollments will increase","**Intro**

LRN (Stride, Inc.) provides online curriculum and online teachers for homeschooling and blended schools. In blended schools, students receive online education but attend physical schools. These educational services are often tuition free because many school districts have automatically renewing, long term contracts with LRN.

The company provides educational services for all students, including AP classes, as well as special education.¬† But they specifically target several groups: students with disabilities (dyslexia, autism, etc.), families that move frequently due to work, and high school students heavily involved in extracurricular activities (mostly sports).¬†¬†

LRN student enrollments spiked up at the beginning of the pandemic.¬† They increased 57% in the 2020-21 academic year: to 195,000 vs. 124,000 the previous year.¬† As restrictions were lifted, enrollments decreased.¬† Enrollments were down: 5,000 in ‚Äò21-22 and 16,000 in ‚Äò22-23. But, in ‚Äò23-24, enrollments surprisingly sharply increased by 20,000.¬† Enrollments and guidance for the full ‚Äò24-25 academic year will be announced in October. There are multiple factors that will lead to accelerating enrollment and earnings growth.

**Standardized test scores and behavior**

[Reading and math scores have dropped](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=38) 7 & 14 scale points respectively from their all time highs a decade ago. Nationwide, USA reading scores are now at levels last seen in 1975.¬† And math scores have not been this low since 1990.¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/wyohejt5wknd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d10a86f9cdb6910370e89ac2be18cb049e935220



In a May 2024 survey, 75% of schools reported student lack of focus or attention had a moderate or severe effect on learning.¬† And 79% of schools reported some level of verbal abuse by students directed at teachers or staff.

Standardized test scores & behavior/attention problems correlate with quality of education. If parents believe the quality of education is lower, they are more likely to search for available alternatives.¬†¬†

**Disabled student population and staffing**

[In the most recently available data,](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/24/what-federal-education-data-shows-about-students-with-disabilities-in-the-us/) there are 7.3 million disabled US students.¬† This is a 14% increase from 10 years prior.¬† The most common type of disability is a ‚Äúspecific learning disability‚Äù, like dyslexia or ADHD.¬† LRN specifically caters to these types of students because they are able to provide specialized services for them remotely.¬†¬†

School districts often have great difficulty filling these positions (as well as positions for general education). [¬†This report found](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/retention-is-the-missing-ingredient-in-special-education-staffing/2024/05) 62% of respondents said it was harder, and only 6% said it was easier, to fill special education positions compared to the previous year. The data backs this up.¬† In Spring 2022, (when there were extreme labor shortages and wage inflation),[ 46% of schools](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp#student-behavior-may24-chart-5) said they still have special education positions to fill for the upcoming academic year.¬† In spring 2024, that percentage increased to 51% of schools! And the situation for general education isn‚Äôt much better with 37% of respondents having a general elementary position to fill in Spring 2022 vs. 44%¬† in Spring 2024.¬†¬†

The overall labor situation in the USA is much better now than it was in 2022, but that‚Äôs not true at all for general & special education.¬† These current staffing difficulties not only cause more parents to look for standard public school alternatives, they also pressure school districts to outsource education services to organizations like LRN.

**Valuation**

Normalized trailing p/e ratio is 20.6.¬† And normalized earnings growth YOY is 51%: $3.86 EPS in June 2024 for trailing twelve months vs. $2.58 in June 2023.¬† That would give a very low PEG ratio of 0.4.¬† (If someone wants to check my math on these numbers, that would be great.)

Revenue growth is good at 11%, but not as strong as earnings growth because I think they did some cost cutting on marketing.¬† But still, we have a p/e of 20.6 for a company with good growth and fundamentals.¬†¬†

Part of the reason it is priced cheaply¬† could be lingering worries about AI progress.¬† In early 2023, there was a sharp selloff of some online education companies.¬† Investors believed AI chatbots would replace preprogrammed education material and even reduce the need for live teaching.¬† But, I think progress has generally been slower than what was expected in late 2022 & early 2023.¬† And some of those worries probably need to be reevaluated because I think we are still a long way off from the replacement of live teaching.

**Position**

170 shares.¬† I plan to hold until at least late October, after enrollments and academic year guidance have been released.

A little class for you regardless who don‚Äôt know what this pimp life is about ,"A little help on what options are for you regards 

I have been reading comments in here and I can‚Äôt believe you little dipgards can‚Äôt even have one aota of brain to think. Despite that I am here to save you and explain what it is you are exactly buying when you buy options‚Ä¶ 

Joe thinks $CHEESE will go up above 5$ soon. Joe however doesn‚Äôt want to buy a lot of $CHEESE stock because his money is tied up in $DICK, however he would be willing to buy $CHEESE later if it does go up. 

Joe goes to his friend Jack who owns 100 $CHEESEs and tells him‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhey Jack I will give you 60$ as long as you sell me your $CHEESEs for only 5$ even if it goes above that price up until next Friday. 

Joe paid Jack a *premium* of 60$ or .60 for a call on $CHEESE with a *strike price* of 5$ expiring next Friday. 
BASICALLY Joe is Long Call on $CHEESE. 

Now from Jacks POV: 
Jack has been jacking off like a regard to his $CHEESE which he bought at 2$. Jack thinks‚Ä¶ 

‚Äúhmm I don‚Äôt think $CHEESE will go to 5$ anytime soon, but if it did, 5$ sounds like a good price to pull out and sell it for green money to pay my wife‚Äôs boyfriend his rent. 

So now Joe comes along and offers Jack this opportunity to make some extra cash (premium) as long as he keeps his promise to sell it to Joe at 5$ (strike) even if it goes way above that‚Ä¶ 

The second Joe went long and offered him the premium, the call contract was created‚Ä¶ Joe went long call‚Ä¶ and Jack went short call. 

As the exp date comes closer, there is less chance for $CHEESE to moon, so the contract is less worth. This is called Theta üò®! It is good for Jack and bad for Joe.  Joe can now hand off the contract to someone else and sell for less (what some of us do here in WSB) or hold til it expires (what most of us do here in WSB). 

Now a contract covers 100 $CHEESE shares. So if $CHEESE goes to 6$ on expiration date. Joe could basically buy 100 $CHEESE from Jack for 5$ and sell it on the market for 6$. That is a profit of 1$ per share or 100$ total. Because anyone who holds this call could buy from Jack at 5$ and sell for 6$. This option is priced accordingly, meaning the option is worth 100$‚Ä¶ this is called *intrinsic value*! wow ü§©.  
If Joe can‚Äôt afford to buy 100 shares x5$ each for 500$  to sell for 600$. Joe can simply just sell the contract back to someone who can afford it. Because the option was priced accordingly to its intrinsic value, Joe makes the same amount of money as he would‚Äôve if he had 100 shares, but the option only cost him 60$. He made the same amount of profit with less investment, this is called üåà*leverage*‚ú®ü•≥ and we love it here! 

Thank you so much for listening to this! ü§§ im so happy you got to sit through story time and maybe learned about something! Let me know if you want a lesson on puts tomorrow! ‚ú® 

TLDR: Jack is short call Joe is long call. Whole lotta $CHEESE and $DICK.

Covered Calls: 52% returns?,"For most stocks right now, it seems that the premium for a slightly out of the money covered call expiring in 6 days is about 1% of the value of 100 shares. If I own 100 shares and sell a covered call for 1% premium every week, that seems like a sure fire way to make around 52% returns a year. Even if the stock goes to the moon and the option gets exercised, you‚Äôre just missing out on those gains, but you still made money on the trade.

A Binger Human Frailty,"Had a bit too much to drink tonight. Got the flat to meself and I'm a bit of an regarded incel.

You know what made the 80's economy amazing? Chaos and the Human Condition that it brought. That's right the same era that brought you Bill and Ted's zany, yet rambunctious excellent adventures, and Terminator a cautionary tale of Pandora's box. It's clear as day it was an era of the unknown, and I think there's a strong philosophical economic lesson to be learned then. The 80's were coming out of a long recessionary period, while much innovation was going on without control or overhead guidance. It was Chaotic, no one could predict what would happen next.

And it's this exact nature that brought forth Human's best trait - our frailty.

Through our frailty, we didn't care about predicting long term wealth appreciation because no one cared. We people looked instead towards utilizing that wealth over hording it. We couldn't predict what advancements and dangers the world would bring , but we had the mindset that if we're going to die, then we'd be sure the next generation was prepared.

So how does this translate to amazing economics? In short, price discovery.

Economic growth was linear, but the markets - o boy were the markets bustling. Fear of the unknown future heavily influenced consumers and producer. Consumers coming out of recession were now able to spend, and scarred by 2 recessions were motivated to start a perpetual inter-generational prepping loop. Producers having to face continuously evolving market and society were motivated to sell at any price and to constantly keep inventory moving. Political Boomers think economic stability was what made the 80's work, but that's wrong. Economic Stability came from changing markets and post recession fear and unknown. And I think this is something special and often overlooked. Humans tend towards (price) discovery when faced with our frailty.

So don't be afraid of a little chaos.",2024-09-08,0.0,-0.4311,-0.21555

Why the Market Bottomed on Friday: A Technical Breakdown,"This past Friday, we witnessed the definitive bottoming of the market‚Äîmark it on your calendars, folks. After weeks of volatility, fear-mongering about inflation, the Federal Reserve, and the dreaded looming government shutdown, the market miraculously found its footing. But don‚Äôt worry, it wasn‚Äôt because of any sound economic or fiscal policy. No, no. It was because of ‚Äútechnical factors,‚Äù the magical force that makes or breaks Wall Street, apparently just in time to avoid that pesky government shutdown. Let‚Äôs dissect the genius behind this market bottoming and sprinkle in some wild predictions while we‚Äôre at it (hello, Meta $600 by 11/11).

### The Technical Wizards Have Spoken

First off, let‚Äôs talk about those sacred ‚Äútechnical factors.‚Äù You know the ones. Moving averages, Fibonacci retracements, the ever-mystical RSI‚Äîbasically, the tools Wall Street traders use to pretend they know the future. When in doubt, just slap a chart up with some squiggly lines, and boom, you have yourself a market bottom. 

Here‚Äôs how it really went down. After bouncing off the 200-day moving average like a trampoline, the market decided that was low enough. Why? Because technical analysis says so, duh. The bulls rushed in, declaring victory over the bears, with many citing the ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù as a sign from the heavens. We all know the ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù works because it sounds fancy, not because it has any bearing on, you know, real economic indicators.

Meanwhile, as the MACD turned positive (whatever that means), everyone agreed that Friday was it. No more dropping. This is the bottom, people! Forget about all those pesky things like inflation, interest rates, and the fact that the economy is possibly teetering on a recession. The charts said ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù and so we bought.

### The Looming Government Shutdown That Wasn‚Äôt

But, of course, let‚Äôs not ignore the real savior of the markets‚ÄîCongress. Yes, that beacon of efficiency and bipartisanship that we all trust so much. The threat of a government shutdown was enough to send shivers down the spine of investors everywhere. But in a twist that shocked absolutely no one, Congress avoided it. Sort of. For now.

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúHow could avoiding a shutdown actually cause the market to bottom?‚Äù Simple. When faced with the threat of government incompetence grinding the economy to a halt, investors suddenly remembered that Congress has a long and storied history of kicking the can down the road. There was never any real risk! They were going to do what they do best: wait until the absolute last minute and then barely pass something to keep the lights on for a few more weeks. Markets love that kind of predictability.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: the more dysfunction in Washington, the more the market loves it. Why? Because the less Congress does, the less they interfere with the glorious workings of capitalism. So naturally, as soon as they did just enough to avoid a shutdown, the markets breathed a sigh of relief and bottomed out.

### The Ever-Present ‚ÄúWall of Worry‚Äù

Ah yes, the ‚Äúwall of worry.‚Äù The thing that markets *love* to climb. Inflation? Worry. Rising interest rates? Worry. Recession fears? Worry. An energy crisis brewing in Europe? Worry. The wall of worry is higher than ever, but here‚Äôs the thing about markets‚Äîthey don‚Äôt care. In fact, they thrive on this stuff.

See, when everyone‚Äôs worried, it means the market is ‚Äúclimbing‚Äù that wall. And nothing says bullish like a good old-fashioned sense of impending doom, right? When retail investors are freaking out about their 401(k)s, that‚Äôs when the real pros come in and scoop up the deals. Because, as every investor knows, there‚Äôs nothing more bullish than a market that looks like it‚Äôs about to collapse. 

### Why Meta Will Hit $600 by 11/11 (Yes, Really)

Now, let‚Äôs talk Meta. Why $600 by November 11? Is it based on any fundamental analysis of the company‚Äôs earnings, growth prospects, or Zuckerberg‚Äôs grand metaverse ambitions? Of course not! It‚Äôs based on the fact that everyone *wants* it to hit $600. And if we‚Äôve learned anything from the past few years, it‚Äôs that what retail investors want, they get.

You see, Meta‚Äôs been climbing its own wall of worry. People said the metaverse was a pipe dream, that Meta was spending too much, and that their ad revenue was doomed. But just like the market on Friday, Meta is bottoming. Why? Because technical factors said so. And also because if you throw enough money at virtual reality, eventually something has to stick, right?

So buckle up, dear readers. We‚Äôre in for a ride. The market has bottomed, the wall of worry is crumbling, and Meta is on a collision course with $600 by 11/11. Why? Because it‚Äôs 2024, and that‚Äôs just how things work now. 

Don't fight the technicals!

A Definitive and Certain Look at the Future of Boeing,"Shut your pie holes and crack open your earholes, degens, weed lovers, and occupants of the famed dumpster out back, because I‚Äôve been staring at charts as wide as your mother and I‚Äôve figured out exactly where Boeing goes from here.

It required a diligent search, but after weeks of mind-numbing, soul-crushing toil, it finally clicked with me. We already know where Boeing is going. Why?

Because we‚Äôve seen it before.

Here, with an adjusted accuracy rating of a billion four, IV of 420%, bid of 0.28 and ask of 84.53, is what will happen to Boeing in the next five years:


‚Ä¢ BA representatives will be kicked out of a meeting with representatives of the Federal Reserve after fighting a security guard

‚Ä¢‚Å† CEO will declare ""Don't touch me. I'm the stock exchange""

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†CEO will demand a trade from the NYSE

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†CFO will start calling themselves ""Mr. Big Chest""

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A mid-level procurement analyst will throw a fit over Intel winning Nasdaq MVP and will trash them on social media

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†(Allegedly) nix a trade that would've sent Boeing to TSX

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Random engineering department will show up to NYSE training camp in a hot air balloon

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same engineering department will hold out and refuse to show up to NYSE training camp because the NYSE would not approve their blueprints because the dirigibles relied on 1800‚Äôs technology

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†COO will freeze his feet

‚Ä¢ Same engineering department will try to paint over their old designs and pass them off as new ones, hoping no one would notice I guess

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same engineering department will acquire a newer version of the same model of blueprint, which the NYSE refused to let them use before

‚Ä¢ Same engineering department will finally pick a new project and show up to NYSE training camp

‚Ä¢ Same engineering department will get fined by NYSE for not attending camp

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same engineering department will tweet the fines

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Head of accounting will try to fight JPow and call him a cracker. He will have to be held back by the CEO, and then will punt a dirigible down the conference room and shout ""fine me for that""

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Will get fined for that

‚Ä¢ CFO will release a video where he used audio of Patrick Gelsinger, who didn't know he was being recorded, which is illegal in California (full disclosure, Gelsinger has said he gave permission, but the generally accepted theory is that he said that in the hope that it would help get him to show up to the facility and not alienate him)

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Will get released

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†""GRANDMA I‚ÄôM FREEEEEE! FLY LIKE A FREEEEE!""

‚Ä¢ Entire engineering department will go back to college via online classes

‚Ä¢ Will try to outsource their homework to Twitter

‚Ä¢ They will be accused of ""reprehensible behavior"" during the deposition (which is it's own insane thread, btw), which will include, but will not be limited to:

‚Äî‚Å†""Arrived nearly 30 minutes late to the deposition.""

‚Äî‚Å†‚ÄúGroup chanted, over and over, as if a mantra, a narrative of their own warped concept of the proceeding‚Äù.

‚Äî‚Å†‚ÄúActing as if they were above the rule of law, \[the safety engineering division\] proceeded to make a mockery of the deposition process. \[The safety engineering division‚Äôs\] antics were so unreasonable that barely twenty \[20\] minutes into the deposition, their counsel asked for a break \[so\] he could speak with them about their demeanor.

‚Äî‚Å†‚ÄúAfter approximately 20-30 minutes, \[the safety engineering division\] required another break. When the deposition resumed they increased their level of obstructive behavior. At one point, \[the safety engineering division\] refused to answer any questions, instead saying ‚Äúnext question‚Äù in perfect unison no less than 10 times.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Å†‚ÄúSoon thereafter, \[the safety engineering division\] started announcing a countdown, starting at ‚Äòfive (5) minutes,‚Äô and counting down the minutes thereafter. Before noon \[the safety engineering division\] left the conference room.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ The CEO will tweet that the NYSE has to pay him anyway, so they might as well let them trade

‚Ä¢ Will continue with a couple of bizarre tweets about Intel using Boeing for HBO ratings and the NYSE trying to steal his stuff, and will keep using this weird chicken based metaphor

‚Ä¢ Will try out for the TSX and will bring an entourage and film crew to shoot a music video with them when specifically told not to do that

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†CFO will call out a famous politician for his rub and tug massage session forever ago

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†CTO will start training for a boxing match with Logan Paul

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Director of Marketing will tweet ""No more white woman 2020""

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†The attorney representing the the safety engineering division in the suit involving the condo will quit

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†CEO will use a bunch of slurs and profane language towards cops in an Instagram video he will post

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A police youth football league will cut ties with Boeing and return a donation after the release of the video saying there was an ""irreparable rift"" between the department and BA

‚Ä¢ CEO will throw a bag of gummy candy dicks at cops in a separate video he posted

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Marketing department will get dropped by their agent

‚Ä¢ Head of accounting will be involved in a dispute with movers at his home where he allegedly threw rocks at the movers and moving vans. He will be investigated for battery by the police

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Head of accounting‚Äôs personal trainer will be arrested as a suspect in the battery case

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Warrant will be issued for the arrest of head of accounting

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Head of accounting will turn himself in to Broward County Jail wearing a flamboyant teal suit

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Rumors will spread about Boeing signing with Euronext or Nasdaq

‚Ä¢ Boeing will announce retirement from ‚Äúpublic company-ing‚Äù (for what I believe is the third time, it's hard to find a good record of the rest of them)

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Two days later Boeing will want to trade again and will request that the NYSE wrap up its investigation

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†The NYSE will announce an eight week suspension for Boeing

‚Ä¢ Boeing will sign with the TSX on a one-year deal

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Before BA signs with the TSX, the CTO will be accused of destroying a surveillance camera at a Florida gated community and throwing a bike at a security-guard shack, but will not be charged because HOA president ""feared"" retaliation, per police report

‚Ä¢ CTO is under investigation by the SEC for the bike throwing incident

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†COO will allegedly acquire a fake COVID-19 card

‚Ä¢ COO will be confirmed to have acquired a fake COVID-19 card and subsequently suspended for three weeks

‚Ä¢ The safety engineering division will remove their clothes in tandem and throw them into the audience during an exhibition of Boeing‚Äôs next product line against competitors from the Nasdaq

‚Ä¢ The safety engineering division will be subsequently cut from the TSX for stripping on the field. The rest of Boeing will continue to trade in good standing as a special insult to the NYSE, trading under the new ticker BAWL

How do you gain confidence holding a trade?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been trading options for a while now and finally found a strategy that suits me. However, I‚Äôm struggling with one key aspect: knowing when to hold onto a trade. I often spot great setups on $SPY, but I tend to exit early, even after trimming, because I lost over $100k when I first started.

I‚Äôve recently become consistently profitable over the past few months, but I still cut my trades short at 20-30% gains instead of holding for more. Most of these trades often go beyond 100%, and some even hit 1000%. My biggest issue is that I get spooked by pullbacks. If you know $SPY, it‚Äôll sometimes drop $1-$2, do a wick, and then recover before the candle even closes. With all the market manipulation this year, I hesitate to hold for longer.

ASO,"Had a way more detailed DD wrote but lost everything. I‚Äôve been watching ASO for 4 years. Bought in since 20$+/-. Has had a bad past few quarters. But ASO thrives in 2Q. During earnings call they spoke about online sales going up in its weakest Quarter (Q1) 8.2% to 9%  I can see this further increasing due to CEO talking about pushing Advertisement in Q2(Hot months lots of sales). ASO (-20%1Y) during the same time DKS Has gone up (+40%1Y) considering this and considering DKS had a strong earnings and stock went down. I believe you will need to consider the P/E of ASO 8.25 and if it breaks a 3 quarter slump stock will likely rise 10 to 20 % or even more.
Summary: ASO very cheap. Q2 historically very good. CEO talked about pushing promotions in Q2 found it successful in past. July 4, Father‚Äôs Day, back to school. Online sales going up. Previous 3 Q left stock cheap

Trading macroeconomics trends.,"Is trading based on macroeconomic trends, such as going long on $JPYUSD during Japan's rate hikes and dollar weakness, or going long on 20-year Treasury bonds ($TLT) during rate cuts, a good trading or investing strategy?

Are recent Cofinimmo stock price raise and belgian state bonds reimbursement related ?,"I took a position in May 2024 on Cofinimmo (see screenshot).

Since September 4, the stock price has risen sharply without any apparent reason (+6% in two days). There hasn't been any announcement from the company or macroeconomic events that could explain this fluctuation.

However, on September 4, the Belgian government bond issued a year earlier matured and was reimbursed. This bond had raised ‚Ç¨22 billion. Do you think part of this ‚Ç¨22 billion might have been directly reinvested in Cofinimmo by investors who received the bond repayment, and could this reinvestment explain Cofinimmo's price increase?

Warning from the future when new AI HyperScalers are offered to public,"There‚Äôs no way for us regular joes to make or lose money on this.  This is coming someone who has worked in the field and still talks to people working in the field.  

In the near future you‚Äôll have public offerings of AI HyperScalers like Cweave but be warned this is likely going to be pump and dump. 

I‚Äôm not saying this is right but there‚Äôs a lot of inconsistencies you should consider.   

I know everyone is going to say I‚Äôm wrong but I‚Äôve correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.   Many of them years before it happens.  

Over half a decade  ago I was one of the first to test AMD server chips and thought the perfromance/watt would propel AMD this performance/watt ratio gap for anyone in the field is a dead giveaway INTC would dead company in the future.  How long I didn‚Äôt know but I knew Intel was a dying company 6+ years ago.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

3 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I thought they would be the AI leader. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price and possibly the most valuable company in the world.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

Six months ago when SMCI was being pushed on to the public I said it was a scam to fleece retail.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw9c8l/goldman_sachs_and_morgan_knowingly_offering_scams/

I didn‚Äôt know when the timing of the dump was but I said it‚Äôd be under $100 in the future before all the accounting fraud reports came. 

Digging around and talking with people in the field be very careful when Coreweave get offered, it may pump, even for a year but their numbers are going to be cooked.

Cleveland Cliffs ($CLF) The bastion of steel,"Morning all you Regards and Degens i'm here today with your next opportunity to lose everything. 

Cleveland Cliffs had been on a steady decline the last year starting at 20$ in January reaching as low as 11$ this morning. Between declining steel prices and an economic slowdown the industry in general has been taking a hit. 

From everything I've seen, this is just a fire sale üí∞üí∞üí∞

***Streamlining the process*** 

If you've paid attention to this company the last 3-5 years, you'd know of the multiple acquisitions by Cliffs

***2019 Purchase of AK STEEL***
https://www.clevelandcliffs.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/50/cleveland-cliffs-to-acquire-ak-steel

On a side note - this sale included the now known Cleveland Cliffs tooling and stamping. This is an extremely good purchase for a company like cliffs - multiple production plants for automotive manufacturing/ tooling facilities allowing it to dip its toes into other operations. https://www.clevelandcliffs.com/operations/tooling-and-stamping


***2020 Purchase of US operations of ARCELORMITTAL***
This purchase is what allowed cliffs to jump into the NA #1 position for flat rolled steel. If you're familiar with the industry at all, you'd know that theses coils are ESSENTIAL to automotive stamping - the facilities they own can now operate with in-house product (which you can imagine saves even more $) With the huge ""American made"" push we're seeing with EV's and other industries I can only see Cliffs getting propped up like a saint. 
https://www.clevelandcliffs.com/news/news-releases/detail/13/cleveland-cliffs-inc-to-acquire-arcelormittal-usa


***StelCo acquisition***
This is similar to the ARCELORMITTAL acquisition but on a smaller scale - more facilities for flat/cold rolled steel bolstering their #1 position 

***Possible U.S steel acquisition***
Following the announcement of the sale for U.S STEEL ($X) Cliffs made a bid ~8B$ that was ultimately doubled by japanese company Nippon steel. The sale isn't looking to promising for them with Biden and following candidate Harris and Trump both stating they would block the deal to the Japanese company. This put cliffs as one of the remains offers with CEO Lourenco Goncalves saying he's still open to negotiations.


**Optimism**
With the recent developments we've seen - proposed tariffs on Chinese steel, blocking of the US steel sale, needing American production of steel (national security risk) and cliffs steady acquisitions are making me rock hard and bullish. As these fairly new acquisitions are incorporated into the company we can expect to see cost saving and production increases. Also this Goncalves clip: https://youtu.be/kcagi2icXaU?si=-pLkBqM_r_82hqpL

**TLDR:** Within a few years Cliffs has managed to fortify their position as a bastion of American steel - slowly increasing their output and integrating other companies under them. With them dipping their toes into other industries


Positions: 330 shares @14.00$ (averaging down as it drops) 
                  
Mix of options varying from 15-25$ strikes expiring January, August (hoping to capitalize on a possible us steel acquisition)

LLY is beating out TSLA to become a Trillion Dollar company,"LLY is set to become the 1st trillion dollar health-care stock. Eli Lilly has been having major wins since their earnings. Their drugs are no longer in shortage, Zepound was found to have cardiovascular benefits, and their once a week insulin is showing equal results to daily insulin injections.

The cardiovascular benefits from zepound is huge because patient insurances are more likely to cover drugs like this, without patients having to try other medications since it‚Äôs an actual benefit that no other fat loss meds have and it help lower the risk of their patients being in the hospital, which will save insurance companies more money at the end.

The weekly insulin is HUGE. The biggest complaints patients have is the amount of times they have to inject themselves throughout the day. The benefit this will have, is that both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can use this and there is a smaller risk of hypoglycemia/lower blood sugar since there‚Äôs no defined peak with the insulin.

First DD: Bullish on Delta (DAL) through both technical and fundamental analysis in the medium term,"**Overview**¬†

The airline industry is known for being highly competitive, with fuel prices exposure, high customer power, and sector overcrowding driving downward pressure on margins as well as shareholder returns. Airlines are also extremely capital-intensive and require large amounts of debt to finance their Boeing and Airbus fleets. This leads to large interest payments that further narrow margins. The large amount of debt also increases equity volatility, causing airline stocks to be more volatile. Therefore, it is no surprise that the airline industry underperforms the broader market significantly; since its inception in August 2014, the US JETS ETF has returned a total of ‚Äì21% to shareholders over 10 years, or about ‚Äì2% per year. ¬†¬†

Delta is a leader in this industry. In the past 4 months, Delta has dropped from its high of 54 to a low of around 38, a 30% drop characteristic of this volatile sector. This drop can be attributed to three key factors: 1) rising jet fuel prices and declining margins, 2) lower expectations for consumer confidence and air travel growth, and 3)¬†the CrowdStrike outage that wiped out 380 million in direct revenue for DAL. Delta currently hovers around 42 with a trailing PE of 6.1 and a forward PE of 5.9. In comparison, the broader airline industry trades at a median PE of 6.9 and forward PE of 5.6.¬†

It is empirically true that good companies in weak sectors can still generate strong returns; this is the case for Delta, a large company with strong FCF that many ignore or overlook due to the airline sector performance as a whole. My favorite long plays are on stocks with high volatility, attractive valuation, strong cash flows, and recent negative press that fails to fundamentally change its value proposition. Unfortunately, DAL fits all these criteria, and as a result I have come forth with a long thesis. ¬†

**Technical Analysis**¬†

[20, 50, 200 MA for Delta on the daily chart from 2022-2024; signals 1, 2, 3 labeled](https://preview.redd.it/opj7jg4u33nd1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89e90d67a5cf9d1fc7f7934ccc65246100c162f)

Looking at the past 3 years (post-COVID) graph of Delta, it becomes clear that airlines are volatile but also momentous in the longer term. The graph has long stretches of both bullish and bearish runs; to be profitable a trader will seek to time entries into long and shorts within the transition period between bearish and bullish, maximizing¬†exposure to¬†the longer-term trend. My thesis is that we are currently in one of these transition periods.¬†

The red, blue, and gold lines represent the 20, 50, and 200 MA on the daily chart, respectively. We use a combination of three bullish signals to propose a long entry:¬†

* Signal 1: A downward trending 20MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart¬†
   * Out of the 11 occurrences in the past 3 years (red events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 10/11 (91%) times¬†
   * Red event 4 is the only event that fails this signal, while red event 8 lead the bullish run by 1-2 months¬†
   * In the past year, there has been 3 such occurrences, and DAL has continued a bullish trend 100% of the time¬†
   * The last occurrence was 2 weeks ago¬†
* Signal 2: A downward trending 50MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks¬†
   * Out of the 7 occurrences in the past 3 years (blue events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 7/7 (100%) times¬†
   * The 8th occurrence was yesterday¬†
* Signal 3: An upward trending 200MA crosses a faster, upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks¬†
   * Out of the 2 occurrences in the past 2 years (yellow events), DAL has continued a long bullish trend 2/2 (100%) times¬†
   * The 200MA has begun trending upward post COVID since April 2023 and continues its momentum¬†
   * The 3^(rd) occurrence will likely be within the next 2 weeks

These three signals consecutively have signaled strong bullish trends lasting 2-5 months representing 46% and 40% returns, respectively (34-50 and (34-50 and 38-53). We are now sitting at 42, with these three signals poised to align again. The current RSI14 is not high or low but rising, indicating growing momentum. However, we may be cautionary due to the lower-than-average trading volume during the past 2-3 weeks.¬†

Taken together, we project a conservative price target of 56, representing 34% return, within the next 4 months.¬†

Now, before we lose our entire portfolio, let's turn to the fundamentals, as just looking at technical signals is like driving a car by only looking through the rear-view mirror.¬†

¬†

**Fundamental Analysis**¬†

Despite the underperforming and highly competitive airlines industry, Delta is well positioned in the industry. Competition and strategic differentiation by price currently favor premium airlines (see: [Budget Airlines Want to Go Premium. That‚Äôs Easier Said Than Done.](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/budget-airlines-premium-perks-245a1d61)) As other airlines struggle to compete, Delta can capture a larger percentage of the total market in the short term. As a premium airline with brand strength, Delta‚Äôs pricing power will remain until its competitors can effectively compete on quality and experience.¬†

Furthermore, the airline industry has excess capacity as airlines were overly optimistic about demand forecasts post-COVID. As volume players correct overexpansion of routes while shifting away from volume towards quality, we can expect more rational price discipline and subsequent price premiums (and margins) to increase. While 90% of corporations do not expect corporate air travel demand to soften ([Delta Air Lines, Inc. - Delta Air Lines Announces June Quarter 2024 Financial Results)](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-June-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), slowing growth coupled with higher ROIC is preferable to value destruction; Delta‚Äôs key ratios ([DAL (Delta Air Lines) 1-Year ROIIC % (gurufocus.com),](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roiic-1y/DAL) [DAL | Overview (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/overview)) show ROIC strength compared to industry peers, as well as ROIC higher than cost of capital.¬†

Fuel cost impacts on margin may also trend favorably for airlines, as oil prices drop in the short term. With the markets potentially pricing in a Trump presidency, we may see fuel-cost tailwinds for Delta.¬†

Another short-term consideration has been the CrowdStrike outage; while investors have been pricing in the revenue hit, the scale and timeline of Delta‚Äôs recovery is still in speculation.¬†Known for their operational prowess, this one-time, one-week fiasco is unlikely to have changed much except for the direct revenue hit. This event may have led to DAL being oversold in the short term (2 weeks ago). ¬†

A 5-year growth-exit DCF valuation gives a fair value of 64, well above our price target of 56 from earlier:¬†[Delta DCF Valuation | Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y)¬†

* Above model makes reasonable revenue growth assumptions¬†
   * Model projects DAL revenue CAGR of 4.77%¬†
      * Past 15 years, DAL revenue CAGR is 5.75%, or 6.24% removing COVID years¬†
      * Growth projection supported by DAL 200MA¬†
   * CAPEX assumptions are reasonable (11% consistent with historical)¬†
   * Terminal growth rate of 0.5%, Terminal Value 75% of EV ‚Äì reasonable¬†
      * US population growth of 0.4% but trending downward¬†
      * US GDP growth 2-3%¬†
   * Airline industry unlikely to be replaced in the next decades¬†
* Note: if you check out the other valuation models at the above link, all but the earnings power value model forecasts a much higher fair value than the current price of 42¬†
   * This is due to the earnings power value model being reliant on historical earnings, which are heavily skewed due to COVID in 2020 and 2021¬†

Other notes:¬†

* Delta‚Äôs fleet is 40% airbus, making it less exposed to Boeing than other airlines¬†
* Recent US Dept. Of Transportation inquiry may impact share price(airlines including DAL must submit a report within 90 days: [Federal probe targets airline frequent flyer programs | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/travel/airline-loyalty-frequent-flyer-dot-probe/index.html)¬†
* Ongoing litigation with CRWD and MSFT, burden of proof¬†

Our fundamental analysis reaches the conclusion that DAL is undervalued, with the reason for lower multiplies possibly being attributable to the competitiveness of the industry, macroeconomic and consumer spend caution in the short term,¬†jet fuel price uncertainty, and negative events in the short term. DAL should continue to enjoy strong cash flows as it reduces debt,¬†strengthens its¬†brand, and diversifies cash flows (56% of revenue from premium, loyalty, and other streams) in the unattractive airline industry. ¬†

**Conclusion**

Combining technical and fundamental, we can confidently enter long on DAL with a time horizon of the next two quarters; I am looking to trade DAL at a good time, not a long time. Given this timeframe, here are my (updated) positions:¬†

* 30 Dec20-24 50 calls at 1.07 -> 3210
* 20 Jan17-25 50 calls at 1.4 -> 3800
* 40 Jan17-25 55 calls at 0.67 -> 2680

These positions represent a net cost value of 9.69k. May add on more.

China‚Äôs $100 Billion Short Against Dollar Enriches Hedge Funds,"China‚Äôs embrace of a stealthy strategy to manage its  currency is exposing the nation‚Äôs banks to¬†billions of dollars of potential losses¬†‚Äî¬†and handing easy profits to investors on the other side of the trade.¬†

By some estimates, Chinese banks have used swaps¬†to build short positions in the dollar exceeding $100 billion since last year.

September DD: Why timing the Market may better for your ports,"Hello Everyone,

Today I present a simple Due Diligence (DD) analysis on the month of September and why it may be beneficial to hold cash or remain on the sidelines instead of maintaining a constant bullish position. **TLDR at the bottom.**

We've all heard of the term ""Septembear,"" but how accurate is it? 

In this DD, we will explore the outcome of buying and holding through September versus selling on August 31st for cash and re-entering on October 1st each year.

  
Methodology: Let's explore the data! First, let me explain the methodology. We will be using a popular and user-friendly backtesting tool, Portfolio Visualizer.

[Portfolio Visualiser](https://imgur.com/a/Uz5XDmy)

Using this website, I will present data on two popular leveraged ETFs: TQQQ and UPRO. By using leveraged ETFs, we can see a more significant difference between the two strategies.

The TQQQ Experiment: Let's start with the TQQQ portfolio. Since Portfolio Visualizer can only go back to 2011, we'll begin from there. Here's the setup:

1. Initial investment: $10,000
2. Start date: January 1, 2011
3. Strategy:
   * Sell on August 31st each year
   * Re-enter on October 1st each year
   * Repeat until present day

[Here is the visual of the setup.](https://imgur.com/a/FsHrDt0)

We'll compare this to a simple buy-and-hold strategy from 2011 to the present.

[Here are the outcomes for TQQQ](https://imgur.com/a/Ds4PTGq)

  
Now let's apply the same methodology and comparison to UPRO:

[Here are the outcomes for UPRO](https://imgur.com/a/CTZYhFS)

  
**TLDR/Summary:**

In both tests, it's holding cash during September in the long run would generate by more than 2x better multipliers.

* TQQQ:
   * September-avoiding strategy: 246x return
   * Buy-and-hold strategy: 92x return
* UPRO:
   * September-avoiding strategy: 70x return
   * Buy-and-hold strategy: 30x return

Day 1: NVDA's stock price declined by 2% ahead of its earnings report, likely due to caution and uncertainty among investors.

Day 2: Despite reporting good earnings, NVDA's stock price dropped by 6.38%.

Day 3: The market rallied, with semi-conductor peers rising 5-10%, while NVDA's stock price increased by a modest 1.5%.

Day 4: NVDA's stock price plummeted by 9.5% due to fear and concerns surrounding the DOJ staff.

Day 5: NVDA's stock price experienced a ""rug pull"" from a 2% gain to a 2% decline.

Day 6: After the DOJ issue proved to be fake news, NVDA's stock price experienced another ""rug pull"" from a gain of over 3% to a flat performance.

$PTON the next $CVNA,"$PTON the next $CVNA?

Ever since covid Era PTON stock has been in free fall, to the tune of liquidating the former CEO and hammering his net worth from billions to <$100m. Touted as just a bike with an Ipad the bear thesis has been bankruptcy and fears of extreme customer decline following the re-opening on the worlds economy in 2021/2022.

Whatever your thoughts may be the numbers don‚Äôt lie, and, the numbers are drastically improving.¬†

They‚Äôre expecting FCF of $200m in 2025, with a market cap of $1.7b that makes the stock very cheap. Trouble is they have $800m of debt, something the bears love to tout. Again, the problem with that thesis is they have $700m in cash on hand. If you take into account 2025 FCF estimations they‚Äôre not only surviving but thriving. They have also refinanced that debt and pushed it forward to 2029. A reduction in rates from the fed only makes this debt cheaper and easier to service.

So what about customer retention? >92%, most customers who sign up stay. With their lease model utilising used equipment this figure is expected to increase.¬†

Their tread business grew 42% Y/Y and their Precor business 20% Y/Y

The chart strength post earnings, given the market backdrop, highlights some large money is at play. Pushing through monthly resistance levels and being held up with strong bids. Given the 20% short float and the ‚Äúits just a bike with an ipad‚Äù crowd, I can see this making an aggressive move. As a realist I can understand the bear thesis in 2021/2022. However things have changed since then, People are often guilty of being unable to accept new facts once their mind is made up.¬†

The reason I bring up CVNA is the similar chart pattern at the time, the similar story of a name potentially going bankrupt to suddenly one of a potential turnaround. Also thanks to the ‚ÄúIts just a car garage but in a vending machine‚Äù crowd. You need this extreme pessimism to witness prolonged squeezes. Just like a lot of people will disagree with this post and likely attempt to short it once it pops.

Given the margin of safety, trading a 8x 2025 FCF and almost half its market cap in cash, the high customer retention rate and growth returning. With the right moves this company could easily turn itself around.¬†

I‚Äôm looking to purchase leaps and wait for what I would class as the inevitable. Bear thesis is dead and the chart says we head much higher.",2024-09-05,0.0,0.8061,0.40305

$RYDE Short Thesis,"RYDE (Ryde Group Ltd) is a Singapore based ride hailing startup. Recently listed on the NYSE.

This stock has seen 140% rise this past year. 

My short thesis for this stock is because of the following:

1. The company is not profitable
2. They have been consistently loss-making, recording a net loss of S$4.96 Mn in 2022, which is more than a 3x increase from its losses in 2021. 
3. Shitty cash flow situation. Negative working capital, which will require them to re-raise money. 
4. Competition: They operate in a small, highly competitive and saturated market, going up against giants like Grab and GoJek. They're bleeding cash. 
5. Only a 2.5% market share and no competitive advantages (not much alpha in the ride hailing business) 

So what explains the rise in this stock? Pump and Dump? Speculation? 

I expect RYDE to dip to $7.50. This stock is being pumped on low volume. The bid/ask spread is massive. 

Position: Short 1000 shares at 8.85. Proof attached.

AI and Stock Trading: Hype vs. Reality - What's Your Experience?,"Hello¬†r/wallstreetbets  community,

I've been reading a lot of papers lately about how AI models like ChatGPT could potentially revolutionize stock trading. However, I haven't seen many people actually using these tools successfully. I'm curious about the real-world applications and limitations of these AI models in stock trading.

So, I'd like to ask the community:

1. Has anyone here successfully used ChatGPT for trading? If so, what has your experience been like?
2. For those who have tried it, how exactly are you utilizing these tools? Are they more useful for data analysis, trend prediction, or something else entirely?
3. If you've tried and stopped using AI for trading, what were the main reasons? Were there specific limitations or challenges you encountered?
4. Do you think there's a disconnect between the theoretical potential of AI in trading (as discussed in academic papers) and its practical application?
5. For those who haven't tried it yet, what's holding you back? Skepticism, lack of knowledge, or other factors?

I'm really interested in hearing about real experiences and thoughtful perspectives on this topic.",2024-09-05,0.0,0.964,0.482

"For INTC LEAP regards, INTC ain't gonna print anytime soon - CFO","Intel will begin to generate a ""meaningful"" amount of revenue from its contract chip manufacturing business in 2027, the company's CFO said at an investor conference on Wednesday.

Intel is currently in talks with 12 potential customers that finance chief David Zinsner said will generate some revenue in 2026 and additional cash in 2027. The company has decided not to market its 20A manufacturing process in favor of focusing on the more advanced 18A manufacturing process, the CFO said.

The foundry business currently generates revenue from its advanced packaging business, Zinsner said.

Zinsner did not directly address the reports on Wednesday about Intel failing to produce viable test wafers for Broadcom, a potential manufacturing customer.

The Santa Clara, California-based company is amid a turnaround plan that includes shedding a number of businesses and a 15% cut to its staff. CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are expected to present plans to the company‚Äôs board of directors at a mid-September meeting.

Cuts to the company will mostly be completed by the time Intel announces the current quarter‚Äôs earnings, Zinsner said. The company is considering a wide range of options as it ponders what to cut or keep.

The company is ""not likely to see money"" until the end of the year from the U.S. CHIPS Act, Zinsner said. The act is allocating billions in grants and other incentives to spur chip manufacturing in the United States.

Bubble historian Jeremy Grantham notes 
>The final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now. A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips.

From <https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/let-the-wild-rumpus-begin_viewpoints/> 


[there is an excellent post from klarman on the psychology at this kinda point in the market and the reason the dancing typically continues - [page 1](https://preview.redd.it/xftkwpaahvmd1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=26a3d7c059cf0b6e27a0ee3dad5a7b1f6f840af4) [and 2](https://preview.redd.it/uj86fmybhvmd1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=4ede5e9d0b924b09fb8a856b2c653e0f077a93a9)

So that's what you're looking for. It's not TSLA to look at today (although by any measure it should take a beating too) but of course anything AI.



So those things that make the big running pooping out and then the insitutional guys who cant stop dancing (a reference to musical chairs, expecting music to stop) start going to ""relative"" safety. I say relative like that because this late into bull markets, its pretty fucken common for relative valuation to outweigh discounted cash flow valutation in the minds of many.

DOW index traders - pin point swing trade entry dates and options,"Hello fellow gamble-kin! Having tried most trading strategies over the past decade, I think I've finally cracked the walnut. 

Swing trades over 2 hour time frames with some highly customized indicators. 

The last few dates for swing trade entries I have are:

26-July long DOW

+4 days

01-aug short DOW

+8 days

13-aug long DOW

+16 days

03-sep short DOW

There is no significance to the '+ days' other than a simple count of days. 

Question is, how best would you select an option for these trade dates and what would that trade look like based on these entry points? Options supremo's please indulge or DM. If I can build a formula/ rule for options size, positions, this could become one hell of a money maker. ",2024-09-04,0.0,0.4363,0.21815

$PBF: Insiders can show you when and how to double your money,"The ones who are following know that I love it when insiders wait for the stock to dump for no good reason and load up on it, only to unload when retail piles on and the stock becomes overvalued. The original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), and the [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) was on ATEC, where I doubled my money, at least on paper, and I am diamond handing those October options because I believe in the ATECs upside.

Well, another week another insider trading story. And who is involved this time? Only the richest man in Latin America, and the top 10 richest person in the world - Carlos Slim.

We know he likes telecom and media, but what the hell is he doing using Control Empresarial de Capital to buy up over 18.5 million shares, or about 15% of PBF, a US based oil company? I have no clue personally how this will fit in his global domination strategy, but all I know is that he is acting like a bull in a glass house when buying stock and he is pushing around PBF like a penny stock.

The option premiums are elevated, and rightfully so, and so instead of going al out with single OTM calls like I did with ATEC, I bought a 34/35 vertical spread for 35 cents. I need the stock to tick up to 34 and change to double the money, but if not, I will need to sell some premium in puts or put spreads to make up the losing position....if it turns into a losing trade.

So, I am going along with Carlos on this one. He probably stopped by for gas, and decided to buy the refinery, much like he would buy a telephone company to make a phone call home.

Do your own research, trade small, be careful and good luck!

EDIT: the trade went slightly against me, so on a down day I am financing a portion of it with a short October put.

Reflection on Intel and its recent news,"To those who are praying for Intel selling IFS.

Intel shouldn't even be splitting the company into 2. IDM has always and will be the biggest possibility for Intel to come back to the top. What they need to think is how to lower the cost of manufacturing. To me, they shouldn't be freezing Germany fabs, they should stopped it.

Building the fabs in preparation of Intel 18A while they are the lifeblood of next-gen products are just detrimental to the health of the company. They are going to move majority of the products in house. That means a ton of wafer that is going to be needed. Where can they be build? Currently it seems like much investment have to be made ahead of time, which hurts profit margin so much.

Intel should just license their 18A process node to Samsung, and let Samsung compete with TSMC. What Intel needs the most, is to have a better cost structure. Outsourcing the manufacturing part to Samsung, and keep low-footprint of manufacturing and R&D is the only way to go.

Samsung is backed by a nation, Intel doesn't.                                                                                        Samsung is making profit from the current memory shortage, Intel doesn't.  
Samsung sucks at latest process node technology, Intel doesn't.

Hence, Intel should just let Samsung to be the franchisee of 18A, Intel 3, and possibly any future gen.

It's too costly for them to even consider to build in US. None of them (govn't, companies) are supporting it with real dollars. So why should Pat Gelsinger even has the thought of doing so?  CHIPS act is not enough until there is a second bill. And Intel can no longer afford it.

Franchisee 18A has a couple of benefits.

1. ¬†Samsung offers the cheapest price out of the 3, Intel can pay the best price for each wafer manufactured while being design compatible because Samsung want their first whale customer just like Intel beside itself. Intel has the volume and partnership to negotiate an even lower price than maybe Apple does with TSMC.
2. It's costly to expand new fabs, and next-gen products need 18A capacity so bad. Count the products, Panther lake, Clearwater forest, Falcon Shores, next Rapid, existing 3-party fabless customers
3. Intel should keep growing its packaging revenue as that is easier to scale. It requires less money and less resources while there are plenty of demands. Put less money in fab; while more in packaging. Don't give out everything to Samsung. Outsource a portion of your business to grow your revenue and margin more quickly. To Intel management, investors aren't going to give you more times for what you want to accomplish. Do you want a 50/50 split of manufacturing footprint? Or do you want 60/40 margin ahead of 2030. You are fighting 3 wars at same time, and that won't be easy. All requires resources, while IFS requires the most. You can reorient your business while being IDM. TSMC isn't going to let your margin be saved, find a partner, Samsung. Don't bet foolishly on Germany, or Ohio. Outsource your 18A to Samsung to keep your future products saved. And to have your margin grows ahead of 2030. That's what investors are asking for. Not some 50/50 split on footprint. That is just foolish!
4. Don‚Äôt cut Altera, and you don‚Äôt need the money to build fabs. Who know where you are in four years? Maybe Intel you are dead. Don‚Äôt over promise the fabs. Think smart. Every investment you have reinvested so far has not been that good.
5. 3. Beside TSMC, Samsung has the most EUVs. And Intel doesn't need high-NA for their 18A. Current EUV should be enough. Samsung can just 'Copy Exactly' Intel's fabs. The whole process can be done literally in months, not waiting for fab shell readiness, equipments, technicians.

You are in a very dynamic market, Pat Gelsinger, you didn‚Äôt anticipate PC crash in sales after COVID, you didn‚Äôt anticipate ongoing AI boom. Don‚Äôt lock yourself inside a box. You need flexibility. Being in this debt burden isn‚Äôt going to help you, Intel, or us the investors.

For Intel management again. Act fast, act quick, reduce workforce if you need to, **STOP THE CAPEX**, **FIND A PARTNER**, **DELIVER YOUR PRODUCTS**, and achieve that 60/40 margin goal by 2026. You need one year from now on to have a competitive products in all segments to be able to get that margin again. Don‚Äôt miss your schedule.",2024-09-04,0.0,0.8451,0.42255

"Bank of Canada Cuts to 4.25%, Eyes More Easing Ahead"," The Bank of Canada cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point for a third consecutive meeting, and reiterated that it's ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù to expect more easing to come if inflation keeps decelerating.

Policymakers led by Governor Tiff Macklem lowered the benchmark overnight rate to 4.25% on Wednesday, as widely expected by markets and economists in a Bloomberg survey. 

Officials' communications were little changed since their July meeting, and highlight the central bank's increased focus on balancing the upside and downside risks to inflation, even as they see ‚Äúlittle evidence‚Äù of broad-based price pressures.

But policymakers also reiterated they're concerned about undershooting their 2% inflation target.  ‚ÄúWe need to increasingly guard against the risk that the economy is too weak and inflation falls too much,‚Äù the governor said.

The communications reinforce officials' shift in thinking about inflation -- policymakers are increasingly concerned about downside risks to the economy, and have started gradually loosening monetary policy to engineer a soft landing.

Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Intel's (INTC.O) contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

$4k went into 3 month CDs to hold for taxes.
$4k went into my Wendy's Biggie Meal fund.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives,"The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------

\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.

\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.

\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.

\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.

\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Good areas: --------------------------------------

\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see 

tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity

\*- Gasoline is lower than last year

\*- Retail sales are going fine, \[ per  a recent NPR radio article \]

Nuetral ----------------------------------------

\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.

\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

My one man's take ----------------

Here is why LUNR spiked today ,"I have had some LUNR calls and was shocked when I saw LUNR start rising unexpectedly, especially during this red day. My initial assumption was that some insiders got the news that LUNR was given the NSNS contract from NASA and artificially lowered the price of the stock so they could buy at a low and then sell when the news was released. However, my assumptions were false and the spike today was due to a collaboration with Imagine Dragons and Bethesda.

""Imagine Dragons will also team up with¬†Bethesda Games Studio, for a live debut of their track, ‚ÄúChildren of the Sky (A Starfield Song).‚Äù Additionally, the track ‚Äúwill be transmitted back to Earth from the surface of the Moon as part of Lonestar‚Äôs Freedom Mission flying with Intuitive Machines to the South Lunar Pole in early 2025,‚Äù per a release""

Source: [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/imagine-dragons-live-debut-starfield-160000275.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/imagine-dragons-live-debut-starfield-160000275.html)

This with NSNS contract news that can drop any day now will most likely increase LUNR stock to unseen heights. In addition, I think space stocks are going to be the new A.I. stock in the coming years because both political candidates support space travel and expansion. Furthermore, when the Artemis II goes off it will generate public awareness (Manned flyby missions) which could mean more investments into space.  Artemis II is expected to launch in September 2025 so a lot of time to start investing. Lastly, Artemis III will launch in September 2026 and it will be the first crewed landing since Apollo 17. Apollo 11 had 650 million viewers so imagine how much viewership Artemis III will bring especially when more people will have access to watch it and the fact we have not stepped on the moon like 50 years.

AAPL vs. NVDA Comps,"I consider AAPL a good reference point for NVDA considering there aren‚Äôt many companies with market caps so high.

For the last quarter, AAPL‚Äôs revenue was **85.78B** compared to **30.04B** for NVDA. But of course their margins are different - AAPL‚Äôs is close to **25%**, while NVDA‚Äôs is close to **50%**. That‚Äôs how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA‚Äôs value should be about 77.39% of AAPL‚Äôs. Looking at today‚Äôs market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA‚Äôs value at 78.30% of AAPL‚Äôs, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone.¬†

But of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company‚Äôs valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL‚Äôs net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA‚Äôs **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.

Why then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA‚Äôs net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL‚Äôs did in the past year?

One more thing: I haven‚Äôt accounted for after-hours action, so NVDA‚Äôs slight premium over AAPL based upon net income alone is probably gone now.

Positions: Long NVDA, NVDU, NVDA Dec calls.

NVDAs drop today is the largest-ever destruction of market cap (-$278B),"Shares of Nvidia fell 9.5% today as the market frets about slowing progress in AI. The result was a decline of $278 billion, which is the worst ever market cap wipeout from a single stock in a day.

There were worries last week after earnings but shares of Nvidia steadied after nearly a dozen price target boosts from analysts. But that would only offer a temporary reprieve as a round of profit-taking hit today and snowballed.

Calls on Progressive to profit from pre-earnings run-up,"Progressive (PGR) reports earnings on October 10. I bought 7x OCT 18 CALL 250 contracts to hopefully profit from earnings run-up in IV, plus delta as the market starts to price in what I think will be a good earnings report.

Here's how IV runs up on PGR over their past 9 quarterly reports:

https://preview.redd.it/b09fom8venmd1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f5d15f5dc4198f99c52215c52f2bda53bdc6dd

This chart shows the IV of the option that was closest to the money at the time it was selected and expires soonest after earnings. (The red diamonds are earnings report dates.) Except for Q4, PGR shows a pretty clear run-up in IV starting approx. 30-45 days prior to earnings report.

Theta on the options I bought is -0.1184 right now, while vega is 0.3459, so as the run-up starts, it should push the price up faster than time brings it down.

Additionally, I have a local volatility options pricing model that suggests ATM options on PGR are currently underpriced by approx. 0.84 per share, or $84 / contract, which means this is a good time to buy. IV on these contracts is around 25%, which is near the bottom trough of the ""run-up"" chart above.

IMO Progressive is likely to post a beat this quarter because:

* They had previously made some changes to their monthly accounting schedule which caused them to cut back on some year-over-year comparisons in earnings. This is their first quarter for which they'll report everything ""normally"" again, so investor confidence should be a bit higher as the results are easier to interpret.
* They posted excellent revenue and margins last quarter, despite having a much higher than usual number of severe weather events. They had also jacked rates up to compensate for profitability concerns the previous year. By comparison, this past quarter has been pretty tame, so those higher margins and higher rates should come through as a huge win this time.
* They've been shifting policies out of high-risk regions and into low-risk regions, and after last quarter they have something like 60% of their policies in lower-risk regions. Some states, like Florida, had previously threatened to limit insurers ability to pick and choose safer regions to insure, but they never followed through on the threat, so Progressive should post nice low numbers of claims this quarter.
* The only part of their business that isn't killing it is ""for-hire transportation"", which was impacted by high freight shipping rates in 2023. But freight rates are down in 2024, so this should be looking a bit better in this report. This is a smaller part of their business anyway.
* They've beaten EPS and revenue consistently for the past year, with one minor revenue miss, so it looks like they've dialed in their guidance pretty well. No reason to think their guidance was overconfident this time around.
* Flo is still bangin'. Yeah, I said it.

My plan is to hold these contracts until either I see a 25% gain, a 25% loss, or IV hits 0.35, whichever comes first. I'm hoping 1-3 weeks max.

Reddit's partnership with Google is worth closer to $50M per quarter rather than the reported $15M,"In previous posts, I shared some data on the root cause of Reddit's substantial user growth over the past few quarters: Google.

More specifically, my view is that Google has been using their ""Helpful Content Update"" series of ""core updates"" to their search engine to significantly boost the visibility of Reddit's content. This has been happening for the past 3-4 quarters.

**Partnership deal starting Q1 2024 worth $15.6M per quarter through Q1 2027**

In February 2024, the media¬†[reported on](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/reddit-says-its-made-203m-so-far-licensing-its-data/)¬†the newly announced Data Licensing partnership between Google and Reddit. The terms, as reported, looked like this:

>In January 2024, we entered into certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years. We expect a minimum of $66.4 million of revenue to be recognized during the year ending December 31, 2024 and the remaining thereafter.

When I first read about this deal, I was surprised at how low Reddit went on Google's license, especially since Sam Altman¬†*hates*¬†Google. $15M per quarter is a drop in the bucket for Google and doesn't move the needle much for Reddit either. If you look at the deal from the lens of increased search engine visibility,¬†**the**¬†***actual***¬†**value of the deal is closer to $50M per quarter (perhaps even higher)**¬†for Reddit.

**How Reddit and Google reported their partnership**

From¬†[Reddit's announcement](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-google-expand-partnership):

>**With this partnership**, and via our Data API,¬†**we‚Äôre ushering in new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products**¬†by providing programmatic access to new, constantly evolving, and dynamic public posts, comments, etc., on Reddit.¬†**This enhanced collaboration**¬†provides Google with an efficient and structured way to access the vast corpus of existing content on Reddit and¬†**enables Google to use the Reddit Data API to improve its products and services ‚Äì including supporting new ways to display Reddit content and providing more efficient ways to train models.**

From¬†[Google's announcement](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/):

>**Over the years, we‚Äôve**¬†[seen](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=reddit&hl=en)¬†**that people increasingly use Google to search for helpful content on Reddit**¬†to find product recommendations, travel advice and much more. We know¬†[people find this information useful](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-perspectives/), so we‚Äôre developing ways to make it even easier to access across Google products.¬†**This partnership will facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit information that will make our products more helpful for our users**¬†and make it easier to participate in Reddit communities and conversations.

To summarize, the deal between Reddit and Google was never limited to a payment of $15M per quarter in exchange for access to Reddit's data API. It also included a commitment from Google to make it ""easier to access"" Reddit data across Google products. They have been executing on that deal every quarter since the partnership started.

**Google added over 20M new daily active users to Reddit as of Q2 2024**

They are on track for 30M by Q4 2024. This corresponds to a 50% increase in Reddit's total user base exclusively from increased Google visibility in about a year.

These calculations are based on several things. I won't get into the nitty gritty but the gist of it is this: you can use a regression on Reddit's user growth data from the quarters leading up to the first Helpful Content Update that benefitted Reddit starting in July 2023. You can then diff those predicted numbers with the actual user counts to arrive at the difference in users caused by Google's search engine changes.

\[Go to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1f86raz/reddits_partnership_with_google_is_worth_closer/) and scroll down to see a chart of this. Not able add more than 1 attachment atm.\]

The data point for September 2024 uses Semrush's Organic Keyword count for¬†[reddit.com](http://reddit.com/)¬†to predict the increase in daily active users. As it turns out, the Organic Keyword count metric has the strongest relationship with changes in logged out and logged in daily active users with R-squared values of 0.991 and 0.971.

Assuming that Reddit will appear in the top results for 365M organic keywords by end of Q3 2024 (which is where its current value for that metric stands as of 9/2/2024), you get the following predictions:

* **Predicted Logged-Out Users**: 54,780,763
* **Predicted Logged-In Users**: 43,504,706

https://preview.redd.it/fyygxtnobnmd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=8565321f6dd9d62f73e9fed47a4cfcdbdaf1073b

Visually, this prediction looks correct when plotted against the rest of their daily active user data.

If you make an assumption that Logged Out users are monetizing at an ARPU of $1.20 per logged out user and $3 per logged in user (which seems reasonable and potentially conservative), you get the stacked chart shown at the bottom of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1f86raz/reddits_partnership_with_google_is_worth_closer/) showing upwards of $58 million Google-delivered dollars in Q3 2024.

**Achieving Profitability**

The predicted user counts above reinforce Reddit's Q3 revenue guidance which was $290M - $310M. The predicted user counts come out to roughly $303M for Q3 quarterly revenue which is almost smack dab in the middle of Reddit's guidance.

Conspicuously, they provided that guidance in the middle of Google's July and August core updates which added quite a bit to Reddit's Organic Traffic and Organic Keyword metrics. This suggests that Reddit was potentially anticipating this increase.

On a recent podcast, Steve (CEO) mentioned how happy he was that Reddit was able to scale revenue by 50% per quarter (YoY) while keeping head count fixed. In Q2, expenses came out to about $313M for SGNA, R&D, and CoR. If expenses for Q3 come in close to expenses for Q2, or perhaps something a few percentage points higher, they'll just about break even for the first time ever.

The fourth quarter tends to be higher than the rest of the prior year. Assuming no additional visibility increases by Google and assuming the typical seasonal increase arrives on time, Q4 could be the first time where Reddit meaningfully achieves profitability on a GAAP basis. I believe I calculated $42 million left over assuming revenue of $360M and a 3% quarterly increase in SGNA/R&D/CoR.

Yen Carry Trade: The God-Tier degen strategy or a ticking time bomb?,"Alright, degens, let‚Äôs talk about the yen carry trade, aka how the big dogs like Buffett and Cuban have been milking the Japanese yen for years.  
And what it means for the stock market aka what happened today.

This is what they do: borrow yen at near-zero interest rates, convert it to USD, and throw it into stocks or other assets with fat returns.  
This worked because Japan‚Äôs central bank was practically allergic to raising rates (until recently).  
It‚Äôs been like printing money for them.  

The kicker?  
As the yen kept falling, these guys got to enjoy even lower debt costs. Easy money, right?

But here‚Äôs the twist‚ÄîJapan finally hiked rates for the first time in a decade, and the yen is starting to bite back. Buffett‚Äôs now trimming his Apple stake, and some think it‚Äôs because his yen bet might be going south. So, who‚Äôs still playing this game big time, and how do we stick it to them if the yen suddenly pops? Remember, this could be the mother of all squeezes if things flip.

Don't Bet on Apple's Stock to Surge After iPhone Announcement,">**TLDR: In the past five years, Apple's stock has generally declined on the day of an iPhone announcement. There is little reason to believe this year will be different.**

I have seen some discussion that Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 announcement on September 9 might provide a spike in Apple's stock price, perhaps offering a nice options play.

Based on the past five years of iPhone announcements‚Äîwith the most-recent years being most analogous to this year's announcement than earlier years (being increasingly incremental upgrades rather than offering significant new technologies or features, etc.)‚Äîthat seems to be a bad bet.

But perhaps the announcement will include something spectacular and unforeseen? Just don't bet on it.

NVIDIA Options Expiry: Max Pain $100 ‚Äì September 20th,"As the September 20th options expiry for NVIDIA (NVDA) nears, retail investors, especially those heavy on call options, might be in for a reality check. With 19.13% of all open contracts tied to this date, a lot hinges on NVDA's next move.

The Max Pain Problem:

Here‚Äôs the kicker: the ""max pain"" point for these options is sitting at $100, while NVIDIA is currently trading around $119.37. If the max pain theory holds, market makers could push the stock price down towards $100, turning most options into expensive confetti. In short, those betting on a upward trend might instead face a harsh reminder that ""the house always wins.""

What‚Äôs Next:

Looking at the next couple of expiration dates, the data isn't too strong. For September 6th, max pain is at $116 with only 4.12% open interest, and for September 13th, it's at $122 with just 1.47% open interest. Both dates show a put/call ratio below 1, indicating more calls than puts. This setup suggests we could see a small decrease over the next two weeks, but the real drop could come around mid-September. Given that September is traditionally one of the worst months for trading, any significant downturn could be conveniently attributed to seasonal trends, rather than market manipulation.

How to Play It:

Considering the potential for a shake-up, one strategy could be to buy a put option in two weeks, possibly as early as Friday the 13th. Aim for a delta around 0.3, ensuring a breakeven point at $105. If NVIDIA‚Äôs price drops significantly below $100, consider selling before expiration to lock in gains. Otherwise, I would hold until September 20th.

IV didn't crush you,"What's up assdicks.

The day after every big earnings there's a stream of regards wanking on about how they picked the right direction with an option but were the victims of some mysterious force called IV crush and have been wronged by the market/market makers/bogeyman.

No one did this to you. It wasn't a rigged market. You bought a way OTM option, and it was expensive because there was a reasonable chance that a big earnings report might get the stock there. The earnings report passed, it didn't move that far, and after that there was fuck all chance the stock would get to your ludicrous strike price. Who was supposed to buy that option off you, now that there's 2 days to expiry and you'd need a 10% shift in price to make it profitable at expiry? Are they supposed to pay the same price, or similar, to what they would have paid when there was a huge catalyst coming before the expiry date? No, fuck no, your already remote-chance option is now a fucking pipe dream, so no asshole is going to pay a premium for it.

IV crush is probably a great convenient shorthand for people who understand what an option is, but it has taken on the role amongst the regards of a mythical force that is doing gamblers dirty. This over-technicalisation has become something that people can use to sound knowledgeable while showing their whole ass by admitting their idiocy. Options have two parameters, strike and expiry, and the price is set by what people think the chance of profit is. The Greeks are a way to try and break this down into some constituent parts, they're not the cause of price changes.

What do I hope to achieve from this? I don't know, fuck you. Long live the casino. Buy options that aren't stupid.

HIMS: Dark Patterns and what their Moat is (new take),"**Intro & numbers:**  
There have been a few DD on HIMS in this forum but I have a few new notes to add.

Excellent growth (75% CAGR), 81% Gross Margin (Q2 2024), and trading at about 15x forward earnings...with $1.4B revenue, and 3 consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability.   Almost all of this is prior to GLP1...which added around $10-15M rev. last Q.  No debt.  $200M in bank.  
  
$3.2B Market cap....I see it as at least 3x undervalued just this year.  

They are the #6 health app on Apple apps.

They are taking 54% of all new entrants the entire telehealth market, with about 2M users (estimated, 1.9M as of Q2 earnings).

Insider buy of millions on open market around $16-$19 (board member) and new board members as titans of industry (former Novo COO, Netflix subscription goddess, etc.)

They sell hair loss, weight loss, ED, and Hormone to come soon! among others.

The biggest fear from investors is : This excellent growth can't continue.  Telehealth is the future, HIMS is the growth leader by marketshare, but look at Teledoc!

**Missunderstandings on the stock:**

^(GLP1 shortages are ending, they won't be able to sell it anymore!)

  
-doesn't matter, they will sell customized doses, confirmed on CNBC by LLY CEO btw, or their extremely profitable and cheap to consumer oral (10x the rev of their glp1 currently btw).

^(LLY or NOVO might sue them!)  

-Yes they might.  But if HIMS does what they say they are doing, sell only customized doses of compounded glp1, non patented GLP1 (Liraglutide) made in house (vertically integrated), or orals (also VI), they will not be in trouble.  In fact, they will likely just sell branded in order to bring in customers and then cross sell more profitable products, but more on that later.

^(Teledoc failed! Telehealth is trash)

-You really think people other than boomers with no life want to go to the doctor for ED, hair loss, weight loss, or even most common ailments?  No one wants to do that.  Americans will spend $50 to have mcdonalds delivered with uber eats rather than drive to Mcdonalds for $5.  Americans spend excessively for convenience.  HIMS will give you 1 pakcage a month with all your drugs.  Teledoc was garbagio on a million software platforms, failed to modernize, no margin, no marketing, horifically bad operations, and took 20 years to reach 2.8B rev.  even then it's only at 1/3rd the price to sales ratio of HIMS, showing how undervalued a growing technology first company taking 54% of market share really is right now.



**Finding their moat:**

Look at their website: it's extremely clean and user friendly, uses back and forth dialogue to make recommendations, and when you get to weight loss end boss, it puts Oral Pills (compounded, $70) next to compounded GLP1s (Semaglutide, etc.) for couple hundo. and branded GLP1 as well, so legit Ozempic etc. is available for full price (thousands).  HIMS own COO has been taking the compounded GLP1 as proof of her faith in it.

For the record, the reason you want to see compounded sales increase is because it's extremely profitable vs branded which is a wash.  However, we value growth AS WELL as realize most glp1 customers fall off (fatigue from injecting, lose weight and dont want to inject drugs anymore and try to keep it off naturally as their set point has adjusted).  Here we will likely eventually see cross sell to orals, as they have about 33% of the efficacy.

This cross sell hasn't happened yet, if it does their $2M users will generate absurd revenue.  But it's only had GLP1 for a few months.

So what is different than before?  WHERE IS THE MOAT?  It's in the way they present these products for future cross sell.  It's how they make the user experience excellent.  It's how they market.  It's how the have such efficient operations to have such a high gross margin.

Ok how can marketing and operations be a moat?

Dark Patterns; the very best master this via many methods: Subscription methods, colors on the webpage, wording, packages, bundles, etc.

What companies excel at Dark Patterns?  Amazon is generally considered the best at this, with Prime being difficult to cancel, BUY now buttons all over, subscription models with discounts but still overpaying, and focus on customer experience so we all shut up and overpay for the convenience.  Amazon has at least 11 different Dark Patterns in their buying process.

Marketing is no longer some cut and paste thing in 2020's, nor is branding.  HIMS has mastered both, with an amazing gross margin to boot.  Excellence in all areas of business operations.  When all 3 of the pillars are aligned you have a moat.  Reminds me of Amazon when they sold ""books.""  They spend all of their excess revenue that would be profit into MARKETING.  WHY DO THEY DO THIS?  Because they are taking ALL OF THE MARKETSHARE.  They have KPIs associated to their spend and thus it makes sense to pump as much cash as possible into that!  Remember when people were mad Amazon wasn't profitable?

**Potential upcoming Catalysts:**

There is a rumor of Testosterone replacement therapy coming to HIMS given they announced in Q2 they are bringing hormone therapy to their platform.  Given Test rep therapy lends itself to the subscription model (it's legal steroids, xD) and is basically TAKEN FOR LIFE, this combined with HIMS recently aquired facility (FDA approved) that will be able to manufacture their own Test rep therapy, Liraglutide (a GLP1) and other drugs, means HIMS will continue to take market share, offer all drugs under one roof, and be extremely profitable regardless of if the FDA makes them stop compounding Tirz or Sema versions of GLP1.  TAM for Test rep therapy is $1.8B and will likely grow to $3B in the next 6 years, but i'd anticipate even more TAM growth as US men in their 20s are the least sex'd ever.  Test rep therapy is the fountain of youth and we will see more men trying to date in their 30s and 40s (50s as well) hopping on it, along with many other HIMS offerings.  This is like investing in cat food for all the growing # single mothers out there.  
  
THEY WILL STILL SELL NON PATENTED GLP1, granted it's not as good BUT ITS CHEAP AS FUCK and who is spending thousands on Ozempic?  HIMS was never meant for the rich but luckily the middle class in the US have a ton of expendable income.   

Insider buys: The stock is around where it was when we saw insider buys last quarter, as their financials are improving rapidly i'd be surprised if some new additions don't make some buys as well.

Continued execution: This company has executed quarter after quarter.  It is a beast.

These catalysts are no joke: The stock runs insanely hard when stuff like this occurs so i'd say buy and hold vs. try and time this, it legit will open up 20-30% at a time if there is an insider buy.  Price is down just from a bit of a hangover from the GLP1 yoyo that no one understands fully.  The reason potential lawsuits don't matter: HIMS can just sell branded GLP1 and their own unpatented ones.  They will sell personalized doses just enough to keep

**How to make money on this Asymetric Opportunity on the ground floor of the Telehealth industry:**

The price has fallen around 30% on news of GLP1 shortages ending, despite the fact that in 7 months they had $100M revenue growth in their oral weight loss pill alone, at $70.  Even if the FDA no longer allows them to compound, they will continue to sell branded GLP1 and that gets customers to...YOU GUESSED IT, DARK PATTERN buttons with subscriptions and other extras and substitutions for orals etc. that will maintain some margin and most importantly: FUEL GROWTH.

I think this 30% pullback and extreme drop in volume and IV make long term call options very interesting again right now.  I'd suspect we see $45 end of year if smart money decides this is a risky but great chance at a 10X gain over the next few years.  I think $11 is the floor, but the stock can move fast so if I wasn't already in I'd enter now rather than wait.  It's at $14.7 range...the price they had before GLP1 was announced.

Shares are a smarter play...this stock can skyrocket 20-30% in a day depending on news.

I'm at the point that random locals from the barber to friends are recommending HIMS for random things; not even using the drug names by this point. Just ""go to HIMS for that.""  This convinced me that the cross sell opportunity is there.  People aren't saying ""go shop on Amazon for your semaglutide and ur xyz drug it's super great and nice and clinical and confusing with 3 carts etc....""  

I think there is of course risk they stop executing, but I don't see a more solid opportunity for a 10x and thus the risk return fits my profile.  Granted, my risk profile is infinite.  ",2024-09-03,0.0,0.9992,0.4996

SMCI's form 12b-25 (notification of late filing) - a different outlook on the 10-K filing,"I saw SMCI's 12b-25 report when they filed it, however one thing I could not quite grasp - this check box in Part II:

https://preview.redd.it/lnpo84bpzgmd1.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=e190227038d54bbcb34248e82fd5db4a27c22456

  
I've read only a handful 12b-25 forms before that one, but only [one](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883697/000114036111019521/doc1.htm) with the extension box unchecked, and that company [didn't do well afterwards](https://www.massdevice.com/regen-biologics-files-bankruptcy/).

Several financial outlets wrote that *Super Micro has assured that it will complete the filing within the stipulated extension period with minor performance revisions.*  
That bit of text got certain amount of attention and based on posts and comments all over, people seem to hold onto it. So I dismissed this whole check box thing and accept that we'll be getting the 10-K soon.

But that box kept bugging me, so today I scratched the surface just a little, and noticed that those few outlets all quoted one and the same source, Zacks Investment Research, and I didn't see anyone else other than them reporting it, let alone official statement.

So I dug a little deeper into it. Turns out, **SMCI did make an official statement**, just without much fanfare, and people obviously missed it. **One has to check that box if they believe and/or want to explicitly declare whether they expect to file within the 15 day grace period (which they didn't)**, and Part III of Form NT (only) includes management‚Äôs narrative explanation of the reason why the 10-Q or the 10-K will be filed late. ([link1](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/keeping-current-disclosure-and-governance-developments/20230828-recent-sec-enforcement-activity-serves-as-a-reminder-that-rule-12b-25-requires-substantive-disclosures#:~:text=Rule%2012b%2D25%20requires%20a,and%20less), [link2](https://accounting.unibocconi.eu/sites/default/files/files/media/attachments/BDK_BocconiPresentation_June201220120605171817.pdf))

So now what? Maybe they will report it on time, but the company management obviously isn't sure (and therefore wouldn't check the extension box), so they distanced themselves from further accusations if the company doesn't file 10-K on time.  
One has to understand that filing a 12b-25 is not a thing you file to buy yourself some time because you think you will be able to fulfill your obligations on time, and all you need is just a simple extension, but because you're required to do so when you are late.  
  
Maybe nothing happens, but this just keeps getting more and more interesting!

The complete 12b-25 form can be seen on SEC site [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1375365/000137536524000031/smci-form12bx25nt10xkx2024.htm).  


TL;DR: SMCI didn't check the extension box on their 12b-25 filing, and the only reports saying they'll file on time are from one source, Zacks. So, it looks like the company is not confident about meeting the deadline, and things could get really spicy very soon!",2024-09-03,0.0,0.9576,0.4788

Detail analysis: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stocks,"I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f5l4c6/update_what_if_you_had_just_bought_the_highest/) to take a closer look at various scenarios. My analysis assumes the stocks are bought once a month - at the beginning of every month. It can extended to rebalance everyday but not everyone can do that.

Initial investment: $1,000

Monthly investment: $100

**Strategies**

* Buy and hold: buy the top N market cap stocks of a given month. Do not sell the stock if it's not in the top N list in the following months.
* Rebalance: If an existing stock in the portfolio is not in the top\_n stocks list in the current month then  check when was the last month it was part of the top\_n market cap stocks. If the resulting month difference is greater or equal to¬†`rebalance_threshold_months`¬†then sell the stock and tax the gains. The sale proceeds (minus short term taxes) are added to the monthly investment budget equally among the current top\_n stocks. If there was a loss then I simply use the total sale proceeds. Eg, Assume AMZN was top 3 stocks last month but not this month.  If the threshold months is 1 then we sell AMZN this month, tax the gains, and distribute the sale proceeds equally to buy this months top 3 stocks.

Backtesting. Start: 2018-1, ~~End: 2024-1.~~ Edit: End 2024-8.

|Rebalance on tax advantage account|1|$19,847|$22,825|$16,142|$15,266|$17,989|

Regardless of the strategy buying top 3 market cap stocks seems most optimal. Buy and hold handily beats SPY and QQQ. And if you have the itch to rebalance then rebalancing on the 3rd month seems most optimal. But note that past performance is not indicative of future performance.

|Rebalance on tax advantage account|1|$129,178|$147,589|$72,899|$58,958|$90,923|

Long term, buying top 3 market cap stocks seems most optimal, regardless of the strategy. Buying and holding handily beats SPY and QQQ. If rebalancing then rebalancing on the 3rd month seems most optimal (maybe 4th or 5th month is even better but I didn't check it).

17% cut in expected production 2025 in Kazakhstan (~45% of world production) announced & there already was a global uranium supply problem ,"Hi everyone,

Now that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...

My previous post on this sub that had a lot of success, explaining the nuclear construction pace in China: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eyj9vf/china\_just\_approved\_the\_construction\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eyj9vf/china_just_approved_the_construction_of/)

Before looking for stocks, you need to understand the drivers of the sector of that stock (imo)

The uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \~45% of world production, announced a big cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts for 2026 and beyond.

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

Utilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME

**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

From 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)

Since early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X

But now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024

A good week ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.

300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe

So now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to solved with a lot of new production that is't available.

How come?

During 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.

An example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.

The production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:

* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026
* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest

While producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024)

And at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.

**C.** On Friday Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

Article: [https://www.ft.com/content/240af090-8684-49dc-a85e-20b535d62dda](https://www.ft.com/content/240af090-8684-49dc-a85e-20b535d62dda)



About the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:

[Source: Kazatomprom \(Kazakhstan\)](https://preview.redd.it/w6vugzwdiemd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=255ca458c714a229442d0926c26ae3ff5e23717c)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

Here are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here): [https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production)

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, contractually forcing producers to supply more uranium, than they actually produce. And in the future those uranium producers aren't able to increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of the uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.

And the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.

And before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

page 10 of this presentation: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

Note: For that slide on page 10 Cameco used data from UxC, 1 of the 2 sector consultants of all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world

With all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. This week we will gradually enter the high season again

In the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.

In the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket.

Note 1: the uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.

Here a link to the Uranium LT price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)

Note 2: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. This week we will gradually enter the high season again

For those interested. No rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before investing in the sector.

4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback,"For those that have not bought the dip... the time is now... Load up because Winter is coming!

# [4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-buy-nvidia-stock-075200614.html)

# 1. Blackwell is coming soon

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's Q2 earnings call that the Blackwell platform will ramp up production beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. She added that Nvidia expects Blackwell will generate ""several billion dollars"" of revenue in Q4. Kress mentioned that demand exceeds supply, a trend that should extend into next year.

CEO Jensen Huang clarified that Nvidia will begin shipping Blackwell in Q4. He touted Blackwell's capabilities and maintained that it's ""going to be a complete game-changer for the industry."" Huang emphasized that Blackwell isn't just a graphics processing unit ([GPU);](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gpu/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=0f94b09d-ad43-40f5-80ac-1a14707443cc)¬†it's ""an AI infrastructure platform"" that offers between 3 times and 5 times more AI throughput than Nvidia's Hopper platform.

Some investors might have been disappointed that Nvidia missed its ""whisper"" earnings number in Q2 despite beating the official Wall Street estimates. However, I suspect the release of Blackwell will soon wipe away those misgivings.

# 2. The $1 trillion data-center migration

It's important to keep in mind why Blackwell and forthcoming innovations are so critical to Nvidia's success. A massive migration of data centers from CPUs to GPUs is underway. As Huang said in the Q2 call, ""$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.""

Don't look at this as an opportunity for Nvidia that's well into the future, though. Huang noted that the company expects its data-center business will grow ""quite significantly next year.""

# 3. The next generation of generative AI is at hand

One reason why data centers need powerful GPUs is that the next generation of generative AI is at hand. According to Huang, ""The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software."" He noted that Nvidia is already using generative AI coding ""quite extensively.""

But while the use of generative AI in coding, chatbots, and image generation is accelerating, Huang argues that's ""just the tip of the iceberg."" He mentioned several other areas that generative AI is transforming, including ad targeting, large-scale recommender systems, robotics, and search systems.

Importantly, training next-generation AI models will require 10 times to 20 times more computing power. This creates a huge growth market for Nvidia, one the company is capitalizing on.

# 4. Nvidia plans to buy its shares hand over fist

There's at least one other reason to buy Nvidia stock after the recent pullback: The company plans to buy its shares hand over fist. Nvidia's board of directors approved a $50 billion stock-buyback authorization. This comes on top of the $7.5 billion remaining on the existing share-repurchase authorization.

Sure, the total amount of authorized-stock buybacks represents less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap. However, the increased authorization underscores that the board believes in the company's future growth prospects. With Nvidia prepared to bet another $50 billion on itself, it could give investors putting up much less money to buy the stock with more confidence in their decision.",2024-09-02,0.4939,0.9944,0.74415

SeptemBEAR is a fluke and a lie,"I‚Äôve seen lots of posts on here talking about how the coming month is historically the worst in the market.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of terribly presented charts, half effort dds and more.  

Controversial opinion, but I have reason to believe this September will be full of pleasant surprises.  Why you ask?  Well, since I have you, please read carefully‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm regarded.  Aspiring restarted.  Nothing I say is close to financial advice you should take, especially considering my portfolio is down 50% in the last week alone.  But why is that you ask?  Glad you asked.  It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm balls deep in calls on retail and tech.

Everyone is saying since we‚Äôre headed into a ‚Äùrecession‚Äù that consumer spending is on hold and tech is on the decline.  Ridiculous.  Dollar General, Walmart, and Target showed that the consumer is simply becoming smarter and cost effective.  Following the deals and shopping effectively for low cost items en quantity.  

I‚Äôm 20 something years old and everyone I know (excluding myself) has given up on the prospect of owning a home.  My friends are buying Amazon, chewy, Walmart, Wayfair, and any affordable brands to better their lifestyle but not break the bank.

Anyway. Onto tech.  Many on this subreddit have been adamant that Nvidia (and tech as a whole) has reached unreasonable earnings ratios and is unsustainable.  While in the short term this may be true, this is honestly astonishing.  Right now, companies like Google and Microsoft are likely the lowest evaluations you‚Äôll ever see in your lifetime.  Nvidia likewise.  None of these behemoths are going anywhere.  You likely won‚Äôt see the monstrous growth you saw with Nvidia last quarter continuing (although I can‚Äôt be sure on that) but that is no reason to think that opportunity is dead.  Google in particular has deep connections to biomedical AI solutions, which albeit premature now, will likely pay off 100 fold once people harness the power of AI biology simulation, including protein folding, hormone distribution, genetic manipulation.

Restartless, the coming rate cuts in my estimate will be surprisingly bullish, with some volatility mixed in.  Sure, historically rate cuts have been bearish, but we are in unprecedented times.  The consumer is doing well, people have given up on saving for a first time home and everyone is avidly consuming.  I anticipate we run up until rate cuts, launch up more, and I can‚Äôt claim to know what happens next.

Thanks for listening to my Ted talk.  If you made it this far that means I wasn‚Äôt banned which is an improvement.

My best year ever,"I sold a bunch of positions into cash lately to protect my gains. And wanted to take a step back and appreciate the growth this year

My biggest trades that moved the needle:

- Owning GBTC, CLSK, and ETHE since mid 2023. Sold them all right before their respective ETFs got approved.

- Bought March monthly SMCI calls on Feb 27, sold March 4 after SMCI popped 20% when it was announced over the weekend that it was being added to S&P500. That put position went from $1.3k to $16k. This also marked the local top you see back in March. Proceeded to degen more on AI and got chopped up, leading to 5 month consolidation valley you see

- shorted $62k worth of NVDA, AMD, and QQQ Aug 1, then Japan announced some scary nothing burger and I made $45k profit. Combo of puts and shares. This lead to the recent breakout

- 65% in cash looking for dip.

Acadia Healthcare is holding patients against their will to increase insurance payouts: NYT,"Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ:ACHC), one of the largest operators of behavioral health centers in the U.S., is holding people against their will to maximize insurance payouts, alleged a New York Times report on Sunday.

In at least 12 of the 19 states where Acadia (ACHC) operates psychiatric hospitals, dozens of patients, employees and police officers have notified authorities that the company was detaining people in ways that broke the law, the report stated, citing records.

In a statement to Seeking Alpha, the company called the report's assertions inaccurate.

According to the report, some patients who came looking for routine mental health care found themselves sent to Acadia (ACHC) facilities and locked in.

The company used laws meant for people who pose an immediate danger to themselves to hold patients who appeared not to have met those legal standards, the report added, citing records and interviews.

The report alleged that Acadia (ACHC) held patients for financial reasons rather than medical ones.

Acadia (ACHC) utilizes a number of strategies to convince insurers to pay for longer stays, the report said, citing employee interviews.

""Acadia has exaggerated patients‚Äô symptoms. It has tweaked medication dosages, then claimed patients needed to stay longer because of the adjustment. And it has argued that patients are not well enough to leave because they did not finish a meal,"" the New York Times alleged. ""Unless the patients or their families hire lawyers, Acadia often holds them until their insurance runs out.""

""Decisions on patient care, including how long treatment may be necessary, are never business decisions made by the Company,"" said Acadia (ACHC). ""The characterization of the few historic cases cited does not represent all facts influencing complex medical decisions made by multi-disciplinary teams led by psychiatrists.""",2024-09-02,0.3182,-0.3213,-0.0015499999999999958

Some Historical Data Analysis on the S&P 500,"I'm just sharing some shit I calculated about the S&P 500, which I'll just call the SP 500.

When you look at the yearly returns on the index since 1928 everything seems pretty normal. You can find 20+ percent returns on the SP 500, even really early (e.g. 1933, 1943, 1958, 1980 etc.) When calculating the moving average of these returns I got 7.97%. When looking at averages from a date to today we find these values:

|1928|7.97%|
|:-|:-|
|1950|9.41%|
|1980|10.48%|
|2000|7.13%|
|2009|12.99%|
|2020|13.27%|

It seems as if the average yearly return is growing. The outlier of 2000-2024 is caused by the massive dot com losses without the bubble's growth.

But I wanted to get the growth in real terms. Side note here if we look at this in a physics perspective, we can look at the SP 500 as a position of something, say a point. Every year it moves, this can be up or down and measured as points or percentage. This growth can be seen as velocity (change in position per time period). The table above is the average velocity of the SP 500.

But the yearly change of the SP 500 is not constant. There will be stretches of good years and bad gay bear years. The change of growth could be called acceleration as in physics that is the name for change of velocity. That is what the above table somewhat shows. There has been change in the the growth SP500. In the linked excel document (will be in bottom in TLDR) I calculated the change of a moving average from one year to the next. And I found the moving average of that; which is constantly decreasing since the more data added to the moving average the less each data point affects it. But we can see general ideas.

The average return of the SP500 grows by 8 basis points (0.08%) every year. At this point I'm kinda confused by WTF I'm doing or even calculating. I calculated some more shit but I'm not sure what it means or even is.

But from what I can see, the index has been growing fast every year. So while some people who say that the SP is growing too fast just because they looked at the normal chart that is just because of how exponential growth works. But there is data to suggest the growth rate is increasing in the SP 500.

What Happens to Berkshire When Buffet Kicks the Bucket?,"I see regular posts on here and other subs regarding how much Berkshire is selling and how they are quickly building up a very large cash position. But I haven‚Äôt come across posts about what happens when the grim inevitable happens.

The current foundation of the company is attributed to the financial success largely brought to it by Buffet and his now deceased (at 99) contemporary Charlie Munger. Buffet is currently 94 years old; with no investing ‚Äòequal‚Äô to trade ideas with anymore; in a slowly changing landscape with retail investors now in the mix; and countless other factors.

I think if they go private they‚Äôll be okay, but if not the future doesn‚Äôt seem too bright to me.

What if Warren Buffett is winding up Berkshire Hathaway? ,"Berkshire Hathaway stock selling is been assumed to be because he's fallen out of love with certain stocks (Apple) or because he wants to build up a cash reserve to take advantage of a predicted crash in the market but what if he's selling up to sell up? Berkshire Hathaway is a company that core competencies has increasingly been overshadowed by its CEOs investment gains in partially owned stock - its price going up on the news that its holding so much in T-bills shows how the price might be being distorted by ""buffett magic."" Market confidence that he can predict a change in the market and that he will be able to time that and exploit it for higher profit with a large cash reserve buoying the price even if the underlying value hasn't change.  $277 billion is an insane amount of cash to hand and it being news probably wouldn't boost the share value for many other CEOs or companies if the source was the same.

If you're a value investor that should concern you- maybe it concerns him as well- if his value is tied up in Hathaway stock and Hathaway stock is overpriced based on his own continued existence what happens to the stock value when he hands over the company, or dies? Would the market react the same way to learning that Greg Abel has $277bn in cash reserves to potentially invest with? Any other company can fall back on its business model to show potential future revenue when the CEO moves on- but the market value of Berkshire Hathaway stock is no longer in the business model of the companies it runs as a conglomerate- its in only having paid a single dividend since 1965 and reinvesting that money wherever they could if the business they directly controlled couldn't take the investment and Warren and Charlie being able to pick more winners than losers.

His business partner of 60 years died last year, he's 94 years old, he's a value investor- instead of cashing out of the stock market because he's eager for another round of further investments what if he continues cashing out all of the partially owned businesses that have so overshadowed the core business in the last couple of decades so he can spin off the operating parts of Berkshire Hathaway into businesses that's value isn't at least partially dependent on him living forever as its CEO? Either that or just selling all the partially owned stock that doesn't fall under the conglomerate and paying out a monster dividend so that when he goes and the slight mania of annual shareholder meetings dies down there is still a core value-focused business there to focus on. The guy who he's picked to replace him is much more of a CEO type than an investment management type- was an energy CEO for a company Berkshire bought out in the 2000s. 

What would you do if this was the case? If he was unwinding his whole market position for at least all the partially owned stock?

UPDATE: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stock and rebalanced anytime a new stock took its place? PART 2,"Okay, so my last post got a good amount of comments.

 If I‚Äôm doing this right, from 1994 to 2023 this strategy averaged 22% in an extreme scenario in which you had to rebalance every year. 

However, as mentioned in the previous post, on average the rebalancing (selling 100% of the previous highest market cap stock and then buying with 100% of my portfolio the new highest market cap stock) occurred every 2.9 years. 

But what if we were to extend the back test to more than just 30 years? Here‚Äôs part 2 of this strategy: 1981-1994. This is how far back I could go, I couldn‚Äôt find yearly returns of stocks listed in the previous years. 

Again, this strategy will ONLY be applied to USA companies as so will the strategy. 

Results: from 1981 to half of 1988 the highest market cap was IBM. The returns during those years would have been: -16.19% in 1981; +69.22% in 1982; +26.75% in 1983; +0.92% in 1984; +26.30% in 1985; -22.83% in 1986; -2.89% in 1987 and +4.5% in half of 1988. 

Then XOM became the biggest market cap halfway through the year of 1988 and kept its dominance until the end of 1991. The returns would have been the following: +10% in half of 1988; +19.63% in 1989; +8.85% in 1990 and +23.30% in 1991. 

At the very start of 1992, GE became the highest market cap stock and it held its dominance throughout 1994. The returns would have been: +15.10% in 1992; +26.04% in 1993 and +0.21% in 1994. 

That leads us to an average pre tax return rate of 26.9%. With taxes, applied on the average of rebalancement during these years, which was 1 rebalancement every 2.14 years (in the calculations I considered every 2 years) we get an average after tax annual return rate of 21.27%. 


But how was the market doing during these times? From 1988 to 1994 the s&p 500 averaged an annual return rate of 13.5%.  The total backtest (part 1 and part 2) proves this strategy would have on average returned twice as much as the s&p 500 over the course of the last 37 years. 


PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT IM NOT CURRENTLY USING THIS STRATEGY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU IF NOT PROPERLY STUDIED BY EXPERTS.

PLEASE DONT JUST RANDOMLY START USING THIS STRATEGY ",2024-08-31,0.0,0.9461,0.47305

NVDA and the September to remember,"My last few posts have been NVDA price action the last week and some random ass (or educated lol) guesses with how earnings would go.

Here was my summary for the week:
- before earnings buy puts if it‚Äôs above $125 and close them out if it drops below that
- also before earnings buy calls if it‚Äôs below $125 and close those out.
- earnings will fuck both sides of the options chain
- I predicted a drop of 3-5% of the stock for Thursday morning
- I expected the stock to fall further and wanted to enter a call position if it fell closer to $110 by the weekend.

I believe some of you made money this week on this approach. Congrats!

The big question is‚Ä¶..what is NVDA gunna do in September?

Well, we haven‚Äôt reached the short term bottom yet. I don‚Äôt care if you follow TA, trends, gap fills, or nana‚Äôs bingo card.

I‚Äôm still waiting for sub $110 and will likely wait until it‚Äôs below $100.

I believe the end of next week is going to be a bloodbath. The last 2 weeks a reddish Thursday was almost completely undone by a bullish Friday and many of these tickers, NVDA included, are going to have their gahhh moment next Thursday / Friday.

Casino is closed on Monday. Fuck Labor Day lol! But now we get all of that compressed into one less trading day for the week.

Here‚Äôs my thought process for the week ahead:

- I expect little to no movement on NVDA leading into Tuesday. 
- Tuesday morning: calls are the play!!! Target 9/6 $1-3 OTM calls, keep it simple and less risky and watch this gain traction to your breakeven price and sell those fuckers before market close! Close those positions!
- Wednesday: more green, but not a lot of price action. Will it hit $125 today? Possibly, but the market does weird shit overnight so eliminate the risk of your gains lost by closing it out. If I play NVDA Wednesday it will be quick swings only.
- Thursday: there are two key times I am interested in grabbing puts. 10am EST and around 12:30pm EST. Why? I think there will be some upward price action to start the day and it will dump down after 30 minutes, then spend half the day recovering before it starts a decline beginning in the window of 12:30-12:55. I believe Thursday night is a great night to be holding puts with short or moderate term expiration.
- Friday: not a green day lol. Gonna be red red red. Will it open low and tank or open high and tank? Personally I like holding puts overnight Thursday and buying in no later than 1pm EST Thursday. I‚Äôll probably give myself a little wiggle room and not do 9/6 expiration but to those who are riskier the bigger gains are in play. 

Best of luck!

TL/DR: NVDA gonna go green Tuesday Wednesday and even into early trading Thursday. Thursday PM into end of week gonna give it allll back. Calls Tuesday, intraday puts Thursday, puts Thursday early PM hold overnight and grab yo tendies ",2024-08-31,0.0,0.9649,0.48245

UPDATE: I lost my life savings shorting copper & a naked call was assigned to me + margin called,"A few weeks ago, I posted on this sub about how I shorted copper because I thought the price of it would crash due to the public backlash of how low quality the bronze metal at the Olympics was. I thought it was an intelligent investment decision and not a gamble (because bronze is composed of about 88% copper) but I got thousands of comments and dms telling me about how dumb my analysis was and that I should sell immediately and quit options.

At first I didn't really listen to these ppl because I was up a little bit on my positions, but then copper started mooning in price and i was down thousands out of nowhere, so I doubled down on my position thinking there was no way it could go higher and I took out some margin and bought more puts on a different strike price to average down, but it kept going higher. Currently I'm down about -$8.5k on my shorts.

Since I only had about $400 of cash in my account left I decided to play around with 0DTE SPY options, I made a little money back initially, but then I woke up today and checked my account and somehow there was a naked call in my account that I didn't even buy, I was only trading long calls and puts but somehow it was in my portfolio and said that i needed to buy 100 shares of SPY as collateral immediately before it closes. I have no idea how this got there, I tried switching to a cash account but it said I had to close my margin positions first, so as the market closed, it automatically bought 100 shares of SPY and now I owe $56k to my brokerage. Im only 19 and essentially my life is ruined and I have no idea what to do or how I can ever repay this, I haven't even told my mom or dad.

"I humbly submit my DD on a not so well known ticker, $DCBO","DCBO, or Docebo, is a learning management system for Enterprises. Basically, they offer a platform where businesses can upload training materials, deliver them to different audiences, and then track/verify completion of said training materials by individuals. That‚Äôs the non sexy version, anyway. 

The company was founded in Italy but later created a North American expansion office, and later headquartered in Toronto. They listed on the TSX, and then a year or so later on the Nasdaq. 

In the last 3 years, they‚Äôve shown impressive and steady growth and captured much of the LMS market share for mid market and enterprise segments. Generally speaking, a $1m+ enterprise RFP for an LMS will eventually be narrowed to Docebo and Cornerstone, they are the two dominate players in the enterprise LMS market.

And now for the meat of my investment thesis. Docebo is working towards Fedramp compliance, as they state on their website. Cornerstone absolutely dominates the government segment. They get all those deals as they are the only enterprise LMS that is fedramp, which the government requires. There is massive, massive amount of government spend on LMS, and cornerstone basically gets it all. 

Once Docebo gets their Fedramp certification, which I imagine will be in the next 6-12 months, they will begin to eat cornerstones lunch in that segment (which is huge). It will greatly impact their revenue growth and they will also sing that Fedramp song from the rooftops, upgrades will come, and I think the stock will roughly double over the next year, possibly higher.

**Top chart** compares S&P 500 Index average daily returns over the three trading days before and after Labor Day in the entire sample to those for a 1990-2023 subsample (34 observations). This chart shows no variability ranges and uses a finer vertical scale than the preceding chart. There are noticeable differences, with the peak the day before Labor Day missing for recent data. These differences undermine belief in an exploitable anomaly.

Variability is relatively high the day after Labor Day for both the entire sample and the subsample.

Some of the differences between the overall sample and the subsample are noise. Could the shift in peaks relate to the turn-of-the-month effect (whether Labor day comes early or late within its one-week window)?

  


**The final** chart compares S&P 500 Index average daily returns over the three trading days before and after Labor Day for the 21 observations when Labor Day occurs earliest (9/1/ or 9/2) and the 21 observations when Labor Day occurs latest (9/6 or 9/7) over the entire sample period.

Forward PE: $21 vs. $42.81
Q2 Revenue: $84.7b vs. $30b

I know NVDA is growing faster than Google, but do we really think it can keep growing fast enough to justify this valuation? 

I‚Äôm not saying that NVDA is a bad investment, but I am saying that NVDA could DOUBLE its income from its historic Q2 and still be significantly more expensive than GOOG, a stalwart Mag 7 conglomerate that is consistently growing its own earnings at ~40% every quarter and has ample AI / growth opportunities of its own that are coming down the pipeline (Waymo, YouTube, Gemini, etc.).

I know GOOG has legitimate question marks about surrounding its business a whole - will the DOJ break it up, will further LLM development render search obsolete, is Waymo scalable, etc. - but NVDAs business has significant doubts as well: will big tech companies continue to spend such an insane portion of its Cap Ex on a product that has yet to return any meaningful return on investment, will big tech companies INCREASE said spending enough to justify NVDA being valued like a company that can continue growing at a high enough rate to justify its current valuation, will a legitimate competitor materialize and cut into their margins?

I‚Äôm not saying GOOG is the obvious choice over NVDA, but I am saying that a lot of things have to go right for NVDA to justify its current stock price, and anyone going all in on NVDA is truly naive to think there aren‚Äôt better investments out there to at least shift some of your portfolio into in order to both limit your exposure and your upside.

TLDR: NVDA is an amazing company that is priced for absolute perfection, and there are other plays out there (namely GOOG) with significantly higher upside.

SMCI - this is far from over,"SMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI‚Äôs margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318292688&type=HTML&symbol=SMCI&cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&formType=10-Q&formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton ([‚ÄúNobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.‚Äù](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-escapes-nvidia-shadow-own-133820520.html)),one has to ask - what is really going on?

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more.

Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares.

Buybacks? With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions.

To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. ([Link](https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=ce4d4770-623d-4e66-a6c9-2679d0c68221))  
Her background is law, and *Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy,* ***litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance***, ESG, executive compensation, ***financial reporting, crisis management***\*, cybersecurity, human capital management, ***investor relations***, M&A, ***securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters***.  
To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts.

TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",2024-08-30,0.0,-0.6302,-0.3151

**Applovin' Warning to Shareholders**

It has been alleged in a newly filed class action lawsuit in CA, that Nasdaq ticker APP (Applovin) has been engaging in the black/greyhat practice of collecting and using very private user data, without their consent. Has this been done to attain an advantage over competitors, and offer better ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to their advertising clients? You tell me.

Consequently, they have had their first profitable full year in 10 years. This makes them a ‚Äúdarling‚Äù on Wall Street. Perhaps shareholders have, or will be impacted by some or all of the things mentioned here,

NVDA Copium ,"So after NVDA tanked massively in After Hours, when earnings were released, on laughable volume of about $50m, I wonder if what we‚Äòve seen yesterday is just a whole lot of unjustified FUD and if NVDA is oversold. Yeah the earnings didn‚Äôt blow everything away, but it was a beat on par with the last ones. 

I mean you‚Äôve seen the massive amount of call options that have been held before earnings. Could it all just have been a massive coup by big institutions to dump the stock price after hours on minimal volumes kicking off a sell off, so that they don‚Äôt have to cover all the long positions they sold? 
Probably I‚Äòm completely regarded for thinking this, but if that‚Äôs the case, it would mean the big players still believe in NVDA and could start pumping the stock as soon as the big hump of options has expired worthless.

I'm thinking a Dec 2026 Put spread, yet to decide on the spread itself, will need to do more DD before I decide on what's optimal.

On a personal note I have lost a bit recently and am finding trading time consuming and stressful. Just opening this position and ignoring it would let me focus on life for 2 years. If I win, I win, if I lose I take it as a lesson and stick to index funds and term deposits in future.

Intel Is Said to Explore Options to Cope With Historic Slump,"""Intel Corp. is working with investment bankers to help navigate the most difficult period in its 56-year history, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company is discussing various scenarios, including a split of its product-design and manufacturing businesses, as well as which factory projects might potentially be scrapped, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel‚Äôs longtime bankers, have been providing advice on the possibilities, which could also include potential M&A, the people said. The discussions have only grown more urgent since the Santa Clara, California-based company delivered a grim earnings report, which sent the shares plunging to their lowest level since 2013.

The various options are expected to be presented during a board meeting in September, the people said.

No major move is imminent and discussions are still in early stages, the people cautioned. A representative for Intel declined to comment, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.""

TLDR: Intel has no idea what they're doing and is freaking out. Grams continues punching air in heaven.

How Rumble benefits from the JD Vance connection and deplatforming by major websites,"JD Vance recently became Trump‚Äôs pick for VP. Vance has been outspoken about his concerns regarding Big Tech censorship, which aligns with Rumble's mission. He was previously personally invested somewhere between 100 and 250k \[[link](https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/annual/b19c901b-c566-4c98-9306-a90ea84a77d7/)\], and is invested in the company through his fund Narya Capital with Peter Thiel \[[link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-j-d-vance-invest-in-rumble-video-platform-popular-on-political-right-11621447661)\]

Given Vance‚Äôs potential to exert influence if he becomes VP (which looks likely given Trump's odds), his continued financial interest in Rumble could have significant implications. This connection could provide Rumble with more visibility and possibly even political support, further solidifying its position as a growing force in the digital landscape.



In recent years, we've seen a growing trend where mainstream platforms like YouTube have de-platformed individuals over controversial statements or views. Regardless of what you think about this, it's undeniable that they‚Äôve created opportunities for alternative platforms to rise.

One of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend is Rumble. Unlike the mainstream giants, Rumble positions itself as a free speech platform, welcoming voices that might be too controversial elsewhere. This has attracted a dedicated user base, especially among those who feel disillusioned by the perceived censorship on other platforms.

Rumble benefits from these ""cancellations"" in a couple of key ways:

1. **Increased User Base:** When popular creators are banned from mainstream platforms, they often take their followers with them to Rumble. This influx of users contributes to Rumble‚Äôs growth, both in terms of viewership and content diversity.
2. **Monetary Gains:** Many of these creators bring significant advertising revenue, sponsorships, and dedicated audiences willing to pay for exclusive content.¬†



With the backing of JD Vance, Rumble could very well become a formidable competitor to giants like YouTube. Whether it can maintain this momentum remains to be seen, but it‚Äôs clear that the platform is on a trajectory worth watching.

Intel CEO Gelsinger says he respects ‚Äòskepticism‚Äô from investors as chipmaker‚Äôs struggles persist,"[Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/)¬†CEO Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday that it‚Äôs been a ‚Äúdifficult few weeks‚Äù since the chipmaker‚Äôs¬†[disastrous earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html)¬†and the company is working hard to address investor concerns.

‚ÄúWe respect some of the skepticism we‚Äôve received from the market,‚Äù Gelsinger said in a fireside chat at Deutsche Bank‚Äôs¬†technology conference in Dana Point, California. ‚ÄúWe believe we‚Äôre up for the challenge.‚Äù

Intel‚Äôs stock price plunged 26% following the company‚Äôs quarterly earnings report earlier this month, its worst day on Wall Street in over 50 years. The shares are down 59% this year, trading near their lowest in more than a decade.

The company has been under¬†[tremendous pressure](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html)¬†in the last few years, as it continues spend billions of dollars building out a chip fabrication business while bleeding market share in its core PC and data center business and failing to make meaningful headway in artificial intelligence.

Gelsinger said on Thursday that the company continues to grapple with AI-driven weakness in its server business. But he expressed optimism about the future.

‚ÄúWe see the finish line in sight,‚Äù Gelsinger said.

He added that the company would soon launch Lunar Lake, which he called ‚Äúthe most compelling AI PC product ever.‚Äù Intel shares rose more than 4% on Thursday, rallying alongside the broader tech sector.

The company has¬†[engaged advisors including Morgan Stanley to](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/23/intel-intc-activist-defense-sources.html)¬†help it fend off activist investor scrutiny, CNBC reported on Friday. Gelsinger didn‚Äôt address the activist issue or the sudden departure last week of industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan from Intel‚Äôs board. Reuters reported that Tan was in sharp disagreement with other directors on the steps the company needed to take.

Gelsinger acknowledged that Intel shareholders are justifiably unhappy with the company‚Äôs performance. Intel announced earlier this month, on the day of its earnings report, that it was laying of 15,000 employees and would explore cuts in its portfolio. Gelsinger said he believed those efforts would pay off, and pointed to ‚Äúsignals‚Äù from external foundry customers in the pipeline.

In the latest quarter, Intel swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period, and revenue missed estimates.",2024-08-29,-0.0516,0.0617,0.005049999999999999
